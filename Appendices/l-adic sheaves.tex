\section{\texorpdfstring{$\ell$}{}-adic sheaves}
    We collect here certain useful facts about the category of adic sheaves on a suitably nice scheme; in particular, we are interested in properties enjoyed by the category of $\ell$-adic local systems.
    
    \begin{convention}[The setting for adic sheaves]
        \noindent
        \begin{itemize}
            \item For the purposes of this appendix, $\calX$ shall be an algebraic stack that is locally of finite type over a base scheme $S$ that is affine, regular, Noetherian and of dimension $\leq 1$, and of characteristic $p \geq 0$ (e.g. $\calX \cong \Bun_G(X)$, with $X$ as in convention \ref{conv: automorphic_side_conventions}); moreoever, we would like to work under the assumption that every finite-type $S$-scheme $T$ is also of finite cohomological dimension. At the same time, $\Lambda$ shall be a Gorenstein local ring of dimension $0$\footnote{Hence Noetherian.} and characteristic $\ell \not = p$ (e.g. $\Lambda \cong \Z_{\ell}$).
            \item For $\calX$ and $\Lambda$ as above, write $\Shv_{\Lambda}^c(\calX_{\lisse\-\et})$ for the category of (\'etale-)constructible sheaves of $\Lambda$-modules on the lisse-\'etale site of $\calX$. 
        \end{itemize}
    \end{convention}
    \begin{remark}[About the assumptions on $\Lambda$]
        It should be noted that we have required $\Lambda$ to be Noetherian because otherwise, we can not guarantee that $\Shv_{\Lambda}^c(\calX_{\lisse\-\et})$ would be a thick subcategory of the abelian category $\Lambda\mod(\calX_{\lisse\-\et})$ of sheaves of $\Lambda$-modules (the relevance of this fact will become clear shortly). In addition, we require that $\Lambda$ is Gorenstein and of dimension $0$ so that firstly, $\Lambda$ - as a Noetherian ring - would admit a dualising complex (in fact, a Noetherian ring has a dualising complex if and only if it is a quotient of a finite-dimensional Gorenstein ring; cf. \cite[Corollary 1.4]{kawasaki_macaulayfication_of_noetherian_rings})
    \end{remark}
