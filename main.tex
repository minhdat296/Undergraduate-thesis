	\begin{abstract}
	    The Langlands Programme is a network of many deep conjectures (and recently, some theorem!) with far-reaching consequences, notably in the realms of algebraic number theory and representation theory. At its core, it is about \textbf{reciprocity}, the idea that Galois groups should admit descriptions in terms of canonical constructions. As a matter of fact, the starting point of the Langlands Programme is what we nowadays call \textbf{class field theory}, the very topic of this thesis. More specifically, we are interested in what is known as \textbf{unramified abelian class field theory}, the simplest version of class field theory, which we shall approach via algebraic geometry. This is not the traditional approach to class field theory, but it will help us understand why the study of Galois groups naturally requires representation theory, which as a consequence, helps us makes sense of class field theory being the same as the simplest case of the Langlands Correspondence, that being for the group $\GL_1$.
