	\begin{abstract}
	    The Langlands Programme is a network of many deep conjectures (and recently, some outstanding theorems!) with far-reaching consequences, notably in the realms of algebraic number theory and representation theory. Its starting point is what we nowadays call \textbf{class field theory}, the very topic of this thesis, which we shall approach via algebraic geometry. This is a non-traditional approach, but it will help us understand why the study of Galois groups naturally requires representation theory, which as a consequence, helps us makes sense of why class field theory is the same as the Langlands Correspondence for the group $\GL_1$.
