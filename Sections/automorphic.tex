            \begin{convention}[The Picard group] \label{conv: picard_group}
                For any base scheme $S$ and any $S$-scheme $Y$, we shall write $|\Pic_{Y/S}|$ for the group of isomorphism classes of line bundles on $Y$, whose group structure is given by tensor products of invertible quasi-coherent $\calO_{Y/S}$-modules.
            \end{convention}
            \begin{definition}[Divisors] \label{def: divisors}
                Let $Y$ be a scheme. An \textbf{effective (Cartier) divisor}\footnote{Historically referred to as a \say{modulus}.} on $Y$ is then a closed subscheme $D \subset Y$ whose ideal sheaf $\calI_D$ is a line bundle on $Y$. Its \textbf{degree} is the \href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0AYQ}{\underline{degree}} of the line bundle $\calI_D$.  
                    
                The set of effective divisors (respectively, effective divisors of degree $d$) shall be denoted by $|\Div_Y^{\eff}|$ (respectively, $|\Div_Y^{\eff, (d)}|$), and as a straightforward consequence of the definition of effective divisors, it is precisely the set of invertible\footnote{A quasi-coherent ideal sheaf $\calJ \subset \calO_Y$ is invertible if and only if its local sections $\calJ(V)$ are principal ideals of $\calO_Y(V)$.} quasi-coherent $\calO_Y$-ideals (respectively, quasi-coherent $\calO_Y$-ideals of degree $d$).
            \end{definition}
            \begin{remark}[Why do we care about divisors ?] 
                Because the function field of the curve $X$ over $\Spec k$ from convention \ref{conv: automorphic_side_conventions} is some (global) field of the form $K \cong k'(t)$, where $k'/k$ is an algebraic extension (cf. proposition \ref{prop: curves_and_function_fields}), and since its ring of integers $\bbO_X \cong k'[t]$ is a Dedekind domain (this is due to Hilbert's Basis Theorem, which tells us that $\dim k'[t] = \dim k + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1$), every of the stalks $\calO_{X, x}$ at points $x \in |X|$ must be a discrete valuation ring. This tells us that there is a bijective correspondence between points $x \in |X|$ and places of $K$ that are trivial on $k'$. Now, also because $\bbO_X$ is a Dedekind domain, every ideal $\a$ therein factors into a (formal) product of primes, say $\a = \prod_{i = 1}^n \p_i^{e_i}$. Furthemore, $\bbO_X$ is actually a PID, as it is isomorphic to $k'[t]$, which is a UFD thanks to $k'$ itself being a UFD, by virtue of being a field. Thus, points $x \in |X|$ are not only in bijection with places of $K$ that are trivial on $k'$, but also effective divisors on $X$.
            \end{remark}
            
            \begin{convention}
                Given any effective divisor $D \subset Y$, any integer $n$, and any $\E \in \QCoh_X$, let us write $\E(nD) \cong \E \tensor_{\calO_Y} \calI_D^{\tensor (-n)}$ (wherein $\calI_D^{\tensor (-n)} \cong (\calI_D^{\tensor (-1)})^{\tensor n}$). In particular, note that $\calO_Y(-D) \cong \calI_D$.
            \end{convention}
            \begin{remark}[Addition of effective divisors] \label{remark: adding_effective_divisors}
                Let $Y$ be a scheme. Because effective divisors are line bundles, they are trivially flat\footnote{Given any line bundle $\calL \in |\Pic_Y|$, the functor $- \tensor_{\calO_Y} \calL$ is an auto-equivalence of $\Coh_Y$, which is an abelian category, so $- \tensor_{\calO_Y} \calL$ is automatically (left-)exact.}, so given any pair of effective divisors $D, D' \subset Y$, one can define a new effective divisor $D + D'$ corresponding to the $\calO_Y$-ideal $\calI_D \calI_{D'}$, which is isomorphic to $\calI_D \tensor_{\calO_{X/k}} \calI_{D'}$ due to flatness, and hence $\deg(D + D') = \deg D + \deg D'$.
            \end{remark}
            
            \begin{convention}[The setting for geometric class field theory] \label{conv: automorphic_side_conventions}
                \noindent
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item First of all, let us fix once and for all a smooth, projective, and geometrically connected curve over an algebraically closed field $k$ (we will actually relax the algebraic closure constraint on $k$ later, as this is simply a matter of convenience).
                    \item For us, $\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)$ shall denote the moduli space of line bundles on $X$. Traditionally, this is usually referred to as the \textbf{Picard stack} and denoted by $\Pic_{X/k}$ (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0372}{Tag 0372}]{stacks}), but we opt for the notation $\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)$ because in the wider context of the Geometric Langlands Programme, one works with $\Bun_G(X)$ for $G$ a general connected reductive group (of which $\GL_1$ is a special case), and to not confuse the moduli space $\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)$ with the group $|\Pic_{X/k}|$ (cf. convention \ref{conv: picard_group}). 
                \end{itemize}
            \end{convention}
            \begin{remark}[The geometry of $\Bun_{\GL_1}$] \label{remark: geometry_of_the_picard_stack}
                Since we are working with a smooth projective curve $X$ over an algebraically closed field (cf. convention \ref{conv: automorphic_side_conventions}) and hence over a separably closed field, the prestack $\Bun_{\GL_1}$ is \textit{a priori} represented by a scheme (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0B9Z}{Tag 0B9Z}]{stacks}) as an fppf sheaf on $X$ (and hence as an \'etale and as a Zariski sheaves, since the fppf toppology is finer than both these topologies). As a result, when considering sheaves on $\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)$, we will only need to know about sheaves on schemes instead of the entire fully general theory of sheaves on prestacks. Furthermore, if the genus of $X$ is $g \geq 0$, then one will have the following decomposision:
                    $$\Bun_{\GL_1}(X) \cong \coprod_{d \geq 0} \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)$$
                wherein each $\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)$ is the moduli scheme of line bundles of degree $d$ on $X$, which is a proper smooth variety of dimension $g$ over $\Spec k$ (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BA0}{Tag 0BA0}]{stacks}).
            \end{remark}
            
            \begin{remark}[Moduli space of effective divisors] \label{remark: moduli_space_of_effective_divisors}
                For any base scheme $S$ and any $S$-scheme $Y$, the \textbf{Hilbert functor} of closed subschemes of degree $d \geq 0$ is the presheaf:
                    $$\Hilb_{Y/S}^{(d)}: \Sch_{/S}^{\op} \to \Sets$$
                    $$T \mapsto \{\text{Finite locally free closed subschemes $D \subset Y_T$ of degree $d$}\}$$
                Should $Y$ be a geometrically irreducible smooth proper (respectively projective) curve over a field $C$ then interestingly, not only are finite locally free closed subschemes $D \subset Y_{C'}$ of degree $d$ precisely the effective divisors of degree $d$ on $Y_{C'}$ for any field extension $C'/C$ (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0B9D}{Tag 0B9D}]{stacks}), but also, one has a bijection:
                    $$|\Div_{Y_{C'}/C'}^{\eff, (d)}| \cong \Hilb_{Y/C}^{(d)}(C')$$
                between the set of $C'$-rational points of $\Hilb_{Y/C}^{(d)}$ and that of degree-$d$ effective divisors on $Y_{C'}$ (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0B9I}{Tag 0B9I}]{stacks}). From this, one see that should $Y$ be proper (respectively Zariski-locally projective) and flat over some arbitrary base scheme $S$, and if its fibres $Y_s$ over points $s \in |S|$ are geometrically irreducible smooth proper (respectively projective) curves, then $\Hilb_{Y/S}^{(d)}$ would be the moduli space of degree-$d$ effective divisors on $Y$; thus, for proper (respectively Zariski-locally projective) and flat morphisms $Y \to S$, let us suggestively write $\Div_{Y/S}^{\eff, (d)}$ instead of $\Hilb_{Y/S}^{(d)}$. It is known moreover that $\Hilb_{Y/C}^{(d)}$ is represented by a smooth proper variety of dimension $d$ over $\Spec C$ (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0B9I}{Tag 0B9I}]{stacks}). By putting everything together, one obtains a moduli space $\Div_{Y/C}^{\eff, (d)} \in (Y/C)_{\fppf}$ parametrising degree-$d$ effective divisors on $Y$, represented by a smooth proper variety of dimension $d$ over $\Spec C$ and naturally isomorphic to $\Hilb_{Y/C}^{(d)}$.
            \end{remark}
            
            It should also be noted that what we have just discussed is not the only way to show that $\Div_{X/k}^{\eff, (d)}$ is represented by a smooth proper variety of dimension $d$. Remark \ref{remark: moduli_space_of_effective_divisors} serves more as a demonstration that there \textit{should} be a moduli space of effective divisors (of a given degree $d$), rather than that there \textit{is} one. In fact, by combining remark \ref{remark: quotients_of_schemes_by_finite_group_schemes}, lemma \ref{lemma: smoothness_of_symmetric_powers}, and proposition \ref{prop: symmetric_powers_of_curves_parametrise_divisors}, we shall see that the functor $\Div_{X/k}^{\eff, (d)}$ is represented by a smooth proper variety of (pure) dimension $d$ by virtue of being naturally isomorphic to the functor of points of $X^{(k)}$ (which, of course, is smooth, proper, and of dimension $d$). It is, however, important to know that $\Div_{X/k}^{\eff, (d)}$ indeed satisfies fppf descent (hence \'etale descent) to prove proposition \ref{prop: symmetric_powers_of_curves_parametrise_divisors}, and since this comes from the general fact that the Hilbert functor satisfies fppf descent, remark \ref{remark: moduli_space_of_effective_divisors} remains necessary. 
            
            We now know that effective divisors of a given degree $d$ are parametrised by some smooth proper variety $\Div_{Y/S}^{\eff, (d)}$ of (relative) dimension $d$, but this is not entirely satisfactory: we would also like to know the identity of this smooth proper variety, and we shall after proposition \ref{prop: symmetric_powers_of_curves_parametrise_divisors}.
            \begin{remark}[Quotient of schemes by finite group schemes] \label{remark: quotients_of_schemes_by_finite_group_schemes}
                For details on quotients of schemes by finite groups, we refer the reader to \cite[Expos\'e V]{SGA1}. For our purposes, we shall only need to keep in mind the following facts: 
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item Let $S$ be a base scheme and $Y$ be an $S$-scheme that is either \textit{(quasi-)projective or (quasi-)affine}, and if additionally. If $G$ be a \textit{finite, flat, and locally of finite presentation} group $S$-scheme acting \textit{freely}\footnote{This is to ensure that the $G$-action induces an fppf equivalence relation on $Y$, since the $G$-action on $Y$ is free if and only if the corresponding homomorphism of sheaves of groups $G \to \Aut_{S_{\fppf}}(Y)$ is injective.} on $Y$, then the \href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/025X}{\underline{algebraic space}} $Y/G$ is a scheme (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/07S7}{Tag 07S7}]{stacks}). 
                        \item If $Y$ is a (quasi-)affine scheme $\Spec A$ then the quotient $Y/G$ will also be affine and will be isomorphic to $\Spec A^G$, thanks to the group-cohomological fact that $H^0(A, G) \cong A^G$. 
                        
                        If $Y$ is (quasi-)projective then $Y/G$ will also be (quasi-)projective.
                    \end{enumerate}
            \end{remark}
            
        \subsubsection{Symmetric powers of curves; the Abel-Jacobi map}
            \begin{definition}[Symmetric powers of schemes] \label{def: symmetric_powers_of_schemes}
                Let $S$ be a base scheme and let $Y$ be an $S$-scheme that is either (quasi-)projective or (quasi-)affine\footnote{In particular, the curve $X$ from convention \ref{conv: automorphic_side_conventions} is projective.}. Then for any $d \geq 1$, the \textbf{$d^{th}$ symmetric power} of $Y$ is the quotient scheme $\Sym^d_S(Y) := Y^d/\underline{\Sigma_d}_{/S}$ of $Y$ by the constant symmetric $S$-group scheme $\underline{\Sigma_d}_{/S}$ on $d$ elements (which is finite, flat, and locally of finite presentation over $S$, since it is represented by $\coprod_{\sigma \in \Sigma_d} S$); here, $\underline{\Sigma_d}_{/S}$ acts via permutations, which is well-known to be a free action.
            \end{definition}
            \begin{convention}
                Because the base field $k$ of our curve from convention \ref{conv: automorphic_side_conventions} is fixed, let us write $X^{(d)}$ instead of $\Sym^d_k(X)$ for simplicity.
            \end{convention}
            \begin{lemma}[Smoothness of symmetric powers] \label{lemma: smoothness_of_symmetric_powers}
                If $Y$ is a smooth variety over some field $C$ of dimension $\leq 1$ then so is $\Sym_C^d(Y)$.
            \end{lemma}
                \begin{proof}
                    Smoothness is preserved by base change, so we might as well assume that $C$ is algebraically closed. The case $\dim Y = 0$ is trivial, so let us assume that $\dim Y = 1$ (i.e. that $Y$ is a curve); in this case, the formal completion of the stalk $\calO_{Y, y}$ at any point $y \in |Y|$ is necessarily isomorphic to $C[\![y]\!]$\footnote{We are intentionally confusing the point $y \in |Y|$ and the formal variable $y \in C[\![y]\!]$ because $(y)$ is the unique maximal ideal of $C[\![y]\!]$.}, since $\calO_{Y, y}$ shall be a finite-type commutative algebra over an algebraically closed field; as a result, the formal completion of the stalk $\calO_{\Sym^d_C(Y), \vec{y}}$ at any point $\vec{y} \in \Sym^d_C(Y)$ is isomorphic to symmetric formal power series ring $k[\![y_1, ..., y_d]\!]^{\Sigma_d}$, which itself is isomorphic to $k[\![y_1, ..., y_d]\!]$ \textit{a priori}. A Noetherian local ring $(A, \m)$ is regular if and only if its $\m$-adic completion is regular, and if $A, B$ are finite-type regular commutative algebras over an algebraically closed field $C$ then $A \tensor_C B$ will also be regular as a $C$-algebra, so $\Sym_C^d(Y)$ will be smooth if $C[\![y]\!]$ is regular, which is definitely the case since $\dim C[\![y]\!] = \dim_C (y)/(y)^2 = 1$.
                \end{proof}
            \begin{proposition}[Symmetric powers of curves parametrise divisors] \label{prop: symmetric_powers_of_curves_parametrise_divisors}
                For each $d$, the moduli space $\Div_{X/k}^{\eff, (d)}$ is represented by the smooth variety $X^{(d)}$.
            \end{proposition}
                \begin{proof}
                    Let us denote \textit{unordered} $d$-tuples by $\<x_1, ..., x_d\>$ and also, write $[x]$ for the divisor cut out by any closed point $x \in |X|$. Now, to begin, consider the following $\Sigma_d$-invariant function, which if shown to be bijective will demonstrate that $\Div_{X/k}^{\eff, (d)}$ is represented by the smooth variety $X^{(d)}$ via \'etale descent (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/024V}{Tag 024V}]{stacks}):
                        $$X^{(d)} \to |\Div_{X/k}^{\eff, (d)}|$$
                        $$\<x_1, ..., x_d\> \mapsto [x_1] + ... + [x_d]$$
                    Now, $X$ is a geometrically connected smooth curve, so it is geometrically normal (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/056T}{Tag 056T}]{stacks}), which in turn implies that the stalk of its structure sheaf over its unique generic point is a normal local domain of Krull dimension $1$, hence a Dedekind domain (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/034X}{Tag 034X}]{stacks}). This implies that every divisor on $X$ splits into prime divisors (which correspond to closed points of $X$), and thus the function $\<x_1, ..., x_d\> \mapsto [x_1] + ... + [x_d]$ is surjective. Dedekind domains are special cases of UFDs, so we have also demonstrated that the function $\<x_1, ..., x_d\> \mapsto [x_1] + ... + [x_d]$ is injective.
                \end{proof}
            \begin{corollary}[$X \cong \Div_{X/k}^{\eff, (1)}$]
                $k$-rational points of $X$ are precisely the degree-$1$ effective divisors.
            \end{corollary}
            \begin{convention}
                From this point on, we shall write $\Div_{X/k}^{\eff, (d)}$ instead of $X^{(d)}$ whenever we would like to put emphasis on the fact that points of $X^{(d)}$ are effective divisors of degree $d$ on $X$ (such as in \ref{prop: the_unramified_abel_jacobi_map_is_a_projective_bundle}), and \textit{vice versa}, we shall write $X^{(d)}$ when symmetry is of importance, like in theorem \ref{theorem: unramified_abelian_geometric_class_field_theory}.
            \end{convention}
            
            \begin{definition}[The Abel-Jacobi map] \label{def: the_abel_jacobi_map}
                Let $Y$ be a geometrically connected smooth projective curve over some field $C$. Then, the \textbf{$d^{th}$ Abel-Jacobi map} associated to $Y/C$ is the morphism of smooth proper varieties:
                    $$\AJ_{Y/C}^{(d)}: \Div_{Y/C}^{\eff, (d)} \to \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(Y)$$
                which section-wise (i.e. at each field extension $C'/C$) associates to each degree-$d$ effective divisor $D \in |\Div_{Y_{C'}/C'}^{\eff, (d)}|$ to its corresponding invertible quasi-coherent $\calO_{Y_{C'}}$-ideal $\calI_D \in |\Pic_{Y_{C'}/C'}^{(d)}|$.
            \end{definition}

            \begin{convention}[Genus of the curve] \label{conv: genus_of_the_curve}
                From now on, denote the \href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BY6}{\underline{genus}} of our curve $X$ by $g$.
            \end{convention}
            \begin{proposition}[The Abel-Jacobi map is a projective bundle] \label{prop: the_unramified_abel_jacobi_map_is_a_projective_bundle}
                If $d \geq 2g - 1$ then every Abel-Jacobi map $\AJ_{X/k}^{(d)}: \Div_{X/k}^{\eff, (d)} \to \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)$ will be a surjective smooth projective morphism with fibres\footnote{Note that these are precisely the geometric fibres, since $k$ is algebraically closed.} over $k$-rational points isomorphic to $\P^{d - g}_k$.
            \end{proposition}
                \begin{proof}
                    Let us note, first of all, that thanks due to a descent-theoretic feature of the \'etale topology, namely \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/024V}{Tag 024V}]{stacks}, it shall suffice to demonstrate that the \textit{set-theoretic} fibres of the Abel-Jacobi maps are in bijection with the set of $k$-rational points of $\P_k^{d - g}$; for the same reason, it also suffices to only show that the Abel-Jacobi map is surjective at each point $k$-rational point $\calL \in |\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)|$. We shall proceed in steps, for the sake of clarity.
                        \begin{enumerate}
                            \item \textbf{(Projectivity):} Let us first apply the Riemann-Roch Theorem (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BS6}{Tag 0BS6}]{stacks}; note that the theorem is applicable to our situation because $X$ is a geometrically connected smooth projective curve and therefore a Gorenstein\footnote{Smooth schemes are Gorenstein because their stalks are regular local rings.} scheme of equidimension $1$ over a field), which tells us that should $\E \in \Vect_{X/k}^n$ be a be a locally free quasi-coherent $\calO_{X/k}$-module of constant rank $n$, then:
                                $$\chi(X, \E) = \deg(\E) - \frac12\rank(\E) \deg(\omega_{X/k})$$
                            where $\omega_{X/k}$ denotes the dualising sheaf (which is a line bundle due also to the Riemann-Roch Theorem) and $\chi(X, \E)$ denotes the Euler characteristic of $\E$ as a coherent sheaf on the proper $k$-scheme $X$. Because $\deg(\omega_{X/k}) = 2g - 2$ (thanks to \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C19}{Tag 0C19}]{stacks}, which is applicable in this situation because $X$ is a proper Gorenstein $k$-scheme such that $H^0_{\Zar}(X, \calO_{X/k}) \cong k$), the above tells us that for any degree-$d$ line bundle $\calL \in |\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)|$, we have:
                                $$\chi(X, \calL) = \deg(\calL) - \frac12 \rank(\calL) \deg(\omega_{X/k}) = d - \frac12 \cdot 1 \cdot (2g - 2) = d - g + 1$$
                            Line bundles are particular cases of coherent sheaves with support dimension $\leq 0$, and since $X$ is proper over a field, we can apply \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0AYT}{Tag 0AYT}]{stacks} to get that:
                                $$\dim_k H^0_{\Zar}(X, \calL) = \chi(X, \calL) = d - g + 1$$
                            This implies that the (set-theoretic) fibres of $\AJ_{X/k}^{(d)}$ over $k$-rational points $\calL \in |\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)|$ are isomorphic to $\P^{d - g}_k$ (empty if $d < g$).
                            \item \textbf{(Smoothness):} $\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)$ is smooth (cf. remark \ref{remark: geometry_of_the_picard_stack}), hence it is regular, and $X^{(d)}$ is also smooth (cf. lemma \ref{lemma: smoothness_of_symmetric_powers}) and hence it is Cohen-Macaulay (because regular local rings are Cohen-Macaulay \textit{a priori}; cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00NQ}{Tag 00NQ}]{stacks}). Moreover, we have shown above that given any $\calL \in \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)$, the corresponding fibre of the Abel-Jacobi map is isomorphic to $\P^{d - g}_k$, and since $\dim \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X) = g$ (cf. remark \ref{remark: geometry_of_the_picard_stack}) while $\dim X^{(d)} = \dim \Div_{X/k}^{\eff, (d)} = d$ (cf. remark \ref{remark: moduli_space_of_effective_divisors}), we have:
                                $$\dim \P^{d - g}_k = \dim (\AJ_{X/k}^{(d)})^{-1}(\calL) = \dim \Div_{X/k}^{\eff, (d)} - \dim \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X) = d - g$$
                            The Miracle Flatness Theorem (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00R4}{Tag 00R4}]{stacks}) can then be applied, which tells us that the Abel-Jacobi map is flat everywhere, and because the fibres are isomorphic to $\P^{d - g}_k$, which is smooth over $\Spec k$, this means that the Abel-Jacobi map is also smooth everywhere.
                            \item \textbf{(Surjectivity):} Finally, let us demonstrate that the canonical map $H^0_{\Zar}(X, \calL) \to H^0(X, \calL|_D)$ is surjective
                        \end{enumerate}
                \end{proof}
            \begin{corollary}[Unramified Galois representations induced by the Abel-Jacobi map] \label{coro: unramified_galois_representations_induced_by_the_abel_jacobi_map}
                Because $\AJ_{X/k}^{(d)}$ is proper and smooth, it is proper, flat, and of finite presentation, so by proposition \ref{prop: etale_homotopy_exact_sequence} there is an induced \'etale homotopy sequence as follows:
                    $$\pi_1((\P^{d - g}_k)_{\fet}) \to \pi_1((\Div_{X/k}^{\eff, (d)})_{\fet}) \to \pi_1((\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X))_{\fet}) \to 1$$
                Since $\P^{d - g}_k$ is \'etale-simply connected (this is a consequence of $k$ being algebraically closed; cf. example \ref{example: etale_fundamental_group_of_a_curve}), one thus obtains an equivalence between the categories of continuous $\ell$-adic characters of $\pi_1((\Div_{X/k}^{\eff, (d)})_{\fet})$ and of $\pi_1((\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X))_{\fet})$ as below, wherein $(\AJ_{X/k}^{(d)})^*$ is the pullback of $\ell$-adic sheaves along the Abel-Jacobi map $\AJ_{X/k}^{(d)}: \Div_{X/k}^{\eff, (d)} \to \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)$:
                    $$\Rep^1_{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}(\pi_1((\Div_{X/k}^{\eff, (d)})_{\fet})) \cong \Rep^1_{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}(\pi_1((\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X))_{\fet}))$$
                    $$\chi \mapsto \chi \circ (\AJ_{X/k}^{(d)})^*$$

            A \textit{non-zero} $\ell$-adic local system $\E \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X))$ is called a \textbf{Hecke eigensheaf} (of rank $1$) if and only if there exists an $\ell$-adic sheaf $\calL \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(X)$ (called the \textbf{eigenvalue} of $\E$) such that:
                $$\cev{h}_X^*(\E) \cong \calL \boxtimes \E$$
        \end{definition}
        \begin{remark}
            It is easy to see that Hecke eigensheaves form a full symmetric monoidal subcategory of $\Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X))$, which we shall denote by $\Eig\Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^1(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X))$.
        \end{remark}
        
        Lemma \ref{lemma: hecke_eigensheaves_extend_to_lower_degrees}, which is regarding the \say{globality} of Hecke eigensheaves is merely a technicality in service of theorem \ref{theorem: unramified_abelian_geometric_class_field_theory}. The reader can safely skip ahead and refer back to it later.
        \begin{lemma}[Hecke eigensheaves extend to lower degrees] \label{lemma: hecke_eigensheaves_extend_to_lower_degrees}
            Let $\E$ be a Hecke eigensheaf on $\bigcup_{d \geq d_0 + 1} \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)$ (for any $d_0 \geq 0$) with eigenvalue $\calL \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(X)$. Then, $\E$ can be extended uniquely to a Hecke eigensheaf on $\bigcup_{d \geq d_0} \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)$, also with eigenvalue $\calL$.
        \end{lemma}
            \begin{proof}
                Consider the following commutative diagram, where $\cev{h}_x^{(d)}$ is given by $\calL \mapsto \calL(-[x])$:
                    $$
                        \begin{tikzcd}
                        	{\Spec k \x \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)} & {\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)} \\
                        	{X \x \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)} & {\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)}
                        	\arrow["{\cev{h}_X^{(d)}}", from=2-1, to=2-2]
                        	\arrow["{\cev{h}_x^{(d)}}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
                        	\arrow["{x \x \id}"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
                        	\arrow[Rightarrow, no head, from=1-2, to=2-2]
                        \end{tikzcd}
                    $$
                By definition, we have an isomorphism $(\cev{h}_x^{(d)})^*\E \cong \calL \boxtimes \E$ for any Hecke eigensheaf $\E$ on $\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)$ with eigenvalue $\calL$, which induces an isomorphism $(\cev{h}_x^{(d)})^*\E \cong x^*\calL \boxtimes \E$ at each geometric point $x \in X$; but since $x \in X$ is a geometric point, $x^*\calL$ is - by definition - nothing but the stalk $\calL_x$, which is isomorphic to $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$, since $\calL$ is an $\ell$-adic local system of rank $1$ on $X$. Next, fix an arbitrary finite set of geometric points $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \in X$ and consider the following for any Hecke eigensheaf $\E_{\calL^{(d + n)}}$ on $\bigcup_{d \geq 2g - 1} \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)$ that corresponds to $\calL^{(d + n)} \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(X^{(d + n)})$:
                    $$(\cev{h}_{x_1}^* \circ ... \circ \cev{h}_{x_n}^*)(\E_{\calL^{(d + n)}}) \cong \bigotimes_{i = 1}^n (\calL_{x_i} \boxtimes \E_{\calL^{(d)}})$$
                which implies that:
                    $$\bigotimes_{i = 1}^n \calL_{x_i}^{\tensor (-1)} \boxtimes (\cev{h}_{x_1}^* \circ ... \circ \cev{h}_{x_n}^*)(\E_{\calL^{(d + n)}}) \cong \E_{\calL^{(d)}}$$
                If we now take $d := 2g - 1 - n$, we will get the following equation on $\Spec k \x \Bun_{\GL_1}^{2g - 1 - n}(X)$, which yields us a \textit{unique} Hecke eigensheaf $\E_{\calL^{(2g - 1 - n)}}$ on $\bigcup_{d \geq 2g - 1 - n} \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)$ from $\E_{\calL^{(2g - 1)}}$ (which we have already):
                    $$\E_{\calL^{(2g - 1 - n)}} \cong \bigotimes_{i = 1}^n \calL_{x_i}^{\tensor (-1)} \boxtimes (\cev{h}_{x_1}^* \circ ... \circ \cev{h}_{x_n}^*)(\E_{\calL^{(2g - 1)}})$$
            \end{proof}
            
        \begin{theorem}[Unramified abelian geometric class field theory] \label{theorem: unramified_abelian_geometric_class_field_theory}
            There exists a canonical monoidal equivalence between the groupoid of rank-$1$ $\ell$-adic local systems on $X$ and the groupoid of ($\ell$-adic) Hecke eigensheaves of rank $1$ on $\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)$:
                $$\Autom: \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(X) \to \Eig\Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^1(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X))$$
            which maps each $\ell$-adic local system $\calL \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(X)$ to a Hecke eigensheaf $\Autom(\calL) \in \Eig\Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^1(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X))$ with eigenvalue $\calL$.
        \end{theorem}
            \begin{proof}
                Our strategy for this proof is to explicitly construct - for each $\calL \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(X)$ - the corresponding Hecke eigensheaf $\Autom(\calL)$, and this will involve three steps:
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item \textbf{(A \say{Hecke eigensheaf} on $X^{(d)}$):} In this step we shall construct an $\ell$-local system on $X^{(d)}$ (hence on $\bigcup_{d \geq 2g - 1} X^{(d)}$); cf. proposition \ref{prop: the_unramified_abel_jacobi_map_is_a_projective_bundle} satisfying an analogue of the Hecke eigensheaf property (cf. definition \ref{def: hecke_eigensheaves}) with the purpose in mind being that by pushing this local system forward using the Abel-Jacobi map, one shall obtain a legitimate Hecke eigensheaf on $\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)$ (hence on $\bigcup_{d \geq 2g - 1} \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)$).
                        
                        The first observation that one can make is that there is an isomorphism $(\sigma^{(d)})^*\calL^{(d)} \cong \calL^{\boxtimes d}$ of $\ell$-adic local systems on $X^d$. Next, notice how there are commutative diagrams of the following form, wherein the maps $\tilde{h}_X^{(d)}$ are given by $(-[x], D) \mapsto [x] + D$ (cf. remark \ref{remark: adding_effective_divisors} and convention \ref{conv: symmetric_powers_of_line_bundles}):
                            $$
                                \begin{tikzcd}
                                	{X \x X^d} & {X^{(d + 1)}} \\
                                	{X \x X^{(d)}}
                                	\arrow["{\id_X \x \sigma^{(d)}}"', from=1-1, to=2-1]
                                	\arrow["{\tilde{h}_X^{(d)}}"', dashed, from=2-1, to=1-2]
                                	\arrow["{\sigma^{(d + 1)}}", from=1-1, to=1-2]
                                \end{tikzcd}
                            $$
                        We thus have, as follows, a $\Sigma_d$-equivariant analogue on $X \x X^{(d)}$ of the Hecke eigensheaf property for all $\calL \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(X)$:
                            $$(\tilde{h}_X^{(d)})^* \calL^{(d + 1)} \cong \calL \boxtimes \calL^{(d)}$$
                        \item \textbf{(A Hecke eigensheaf on $\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)$):} Now, recall from corollary \ref{coro: unramified_galois_representations_induced_by_the_abel_jacobi_map} that for every $d \geq 2g - 1$, there exists an adjoint equivalence:
                            $$
                                \begin{tikzcd}
                                	{\Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(X^{(d)})} & {\Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X))}
                                	\arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "{(\AJ_{X/k}^{(d)})_*}"', bend right, from=1-1, to=1-2]
                                	\arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "{(\AJ_{X/k}^{(d)})^*}"', bend right, from=1-2, to=1-1]
                                	\arrow["\dashv"{anchor=center, rotate=-90}, draw=none, from=1, to=0]
                                \end{tikzcd}
                            $$ 
                        From this, one infers that every $\ell$-adic local system $\calF \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(X^{(d)})$ has the form $(\AJ_{X/k}^{(d)})^* \E$ for some \textit{unique} $\ell$-adic local system $\E \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X))$, meaning that there exists $\ell$-adic local systems $\E_{\calL^{(d)}}, \E_{\calL^{(d + 1)}} \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X))$ corresponding to $\calL^{(d)}, \calL^{(d + 1)} \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(X^{(d)})$ respectively (and ultimately, to $\calL \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(X)$) satisfying the following equation in $\Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(X \x X^{(d)})$:
                            $$(\tilde{h}_X^{(d)})^* (\AJ_{X/k}^{(d + 1)})^* \E_{\calL^{(d + 1)}} \cong \calL \boxtimes (\AJ_{X/k}^{(d)})^*\E_{\calL^{(d)}}$$
                        Next, consider the following commutative diagram:
                            $$
                                \begin{tikzcd}

                            $$
                        which induces the following equations in $\Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(X \x X^{(d)})$ for all $\calL \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(X)$:
                            $$
                                \begin{aligned}
                                    (\id_X \x \AJ_{X/k}^{(d)})^* (\cev{h}_X^{(d)})^* \E_{\calL^{(d + 1)}} & \cong (\tilde{h}_X^{(d)})^* (\AJ^{(d + 1)})^* \E_{\calL^{(d + 1)}}
                                    \\
                                    & \cong \calL \boxtimes (\AJ_{X/k}^{(d)})^*\E_{\calL^{(d)}}
                                    \\
                                    & \cong (\id_X \x \AJ_{X/k}^{(d)})^*(\calL \boxtimes \E_{\calL^{(d)}})
                                \end{aligned}
                            $$
                        and since $(\id_X \x \AJ_{X/k}^{(d)})^*$ is an invertible functor (cf. corollary \ref{coro: unramified_galois_representations_induced_by_the_abel_jacobi_map}), we have, furthermore, the following equation in $\Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(X \x \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X))$, which is precisely the Hecke eigensheaf property from definition \ref{def: hecke_eigensheaves}:
                            $$(\cev{h}_X^{(d)})^* \E_{\calL^{(d + 1)}} \cong \calL \boxtimes \E_{\calL^{(d)}}$$
                        We have thus obtained a \textit{unique} Hecke eigensheaf on $\bigcup_{d \geq 2g - 1} \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)$ from an arbitrary $\ell$-adic local system $\calL \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(X)$.
                        \item \textbf{(A Hecke eigensheaf on $\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)$):} Finally, in order extend the Hecke eigensheaf that we have constructed on $\bigcup_{d \geq 2g - 1} \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(d)}(X)$ to $\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)$ (i.e. to degrees $d < 2g - 1$), simply apply lemma \ref{lemma: hecke_eigensheaves_extend_to_lower_degrees}.
                    \end{enumerate}
                The monoidality of the functor $\Autom$ is a trivial consequence of the definition of Hecke eigensheaves, so we leave this to our readers.
            \end{proof}
        
        \begin{corollary}[Geometric Langlands for $\GL_1$] \label{coro: geometric_langlands_for_GL1}
            By putting theorem \ref{theorem: galois_representations_are_local_systems} and theorem \ref{theorem: unramified_abelian_geometric_class_field_theory} together, one gets a canonical monoidal equivalence of categories as follows:
                $$\Rep^1_{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}(\pi_1^{\ab}(X_{\fet}))^{\cont} \cong \Eig\Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^1(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X))$$
                $$\chi \mapsto \Autom_D(\chi)$$
            What this essentially tells us is that $1$-dimensional continuous $\ell$-adic Galois representations are the same as automorphic forms associated to $\GL_1$, and as such, the combination of theorem \ref{theorem: galois_representations_are_local_systems} and theorem \ref{theorem: unramified_abelian_geometric_class_field_theory} can be understood as a geometrisation of the Global Langlands Correspondence for the (connnected reductive) group $\GL_1$\footnote{Incidentally, this is why it is commonly asserted that the Langlands Correspondence for $\GL_1$ \say{is just class field theory}.}. 
        \end{corollary}
        
    \subsection{Grothendieck's Sheaf-Function Correspondence and Artin Reciprocity}
        As a final step, let us decategorify the left-hand side of the monoidal equivalence:
            $$\Rep^1_{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}(\pi_1^{\ab}(X_{\fet}))^{\cont} \cong \Eig\Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^1(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X))$$
        from corollary \ref{coro: geometric_langlands_for_GL1} to obtain a correspondence between continuous $\ell$-adic characters of $\pi_1^{\ab}(X_{\fet})$ and so-called Hecke characters\footnote{Auf Deutsch: \say{\textit{Die Gr\"o{\ss}encharaktere}}.}, using Grothendieck's Sheaf-Function Correspondence. Doing so will yield us the usual version of Artin Reciprocity for global function fields over perfect fields of positive characteristics, in terms of towers of finite abelian extensions and so-called Hecke characters (see theorem \ref{theorem: hecke_characters}).
        
        We begin with Grothendieck's Sheaf-Function Corresondence\footnote{En Français: \say{\textit{La Correspondance Faisceaux-Fonctions de Grothendieck}}.}, which allows us to formally realise the notion of Hecke eigensheaves from definition \ref{def: hecke_eigensheaves} as a categorification of the classical notion of Hecke characters (cf. theorem \ref{theorem: hecke_characters}). For this, let us first discuss traces of Frobenius endomorphisms on $\ell$-adic sheaves, which unfortunately only makes sense over positive characteristics.
        \begin{convention} \label{conv: finite_base_field}
            From now on, the base field $k$ from convention \ref{conv: automorphic_side_conventions} shall be some finite field $\F_q$ (which we note to be perfect). This gives us access to the (absolute) Frobenius on $X_S$, with $S$ being some perfect scheme over $\Spec \F_q$, which we denote by $\Frob_{X_S}$.
        \end{convention}
        \begin{definition}[Traces of Frobenii] \label{def: traces_of_frobenii}
            Let $Z$ be a scheme of finite type over $\Spec k$. For each geometric point $\bar{z} \in Z(\bar{\F}_q)$, we define the trace of Frobenius on an $\ell$-adic local system $\calF \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(Z)$ at $\bar{z}$ to be the trace of the Frobenius endomorphism on the stalk $\calF_{\bar{z}}$, i.e. $\trace(\Frob_{\bar{z}}^{\flat}, \calF_{\bar{z}})$. Since $\calF$ is an $\ell$-adic local system of rank $1$, one obtains a function as follows in doing so:
                $$\frob(-, \calF): Z(\bar{\F}_q) \to \bar{\Q}_{\ell}$$
        \end{definition}
        \begin{remark}[Traces of Frobenii as functions on rational points] \label{remark: traces_of_frobenii_as_functions_on_rational_points}
            Let us first remark that we do not define functions associated to $\ell$-adic local systems $\calF \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(Z)$ over the set $Z(\bar{\F}_q)$ instead of $Z(\F_q)$ out of necessity, not convenience, and this is because stalks of \'etale sheaves can only be computed over geometric points (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/03PN}{Tag 03PN}]{stacks}). But we do want functions over $Z(\F_q)$ as well, and for this, recall that $Z(\F_q) \cong Z(\bar{\F}_q)^{\Gal(\bar{\F}_q/\F_q)}$. Defining a function:
                $$\frob(-, \calF): Z(\F_q) \to \bar{\Q}_{\ell}$$
            coming from the trace of the Frobenius endomorphism on $\calF$ then becomes a simple matter of domain restriction.
        \end{remark}
        \begin{remark}[Basic properties of traces of Frobenii] \label{remark: basic_properties_of_traces_of_frobenii}
            The following properties are trivial consequences of definition \ref{def: traces_of_frobenii}:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item For any pair of rank-$1$ $\ell$-adic local systems $\calF, \calF' \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(Z)$ and any fixed geometric point $\bar{z} \in Z(\bar{\F}_q)$, one has:
                        $$\frob(\bar{z}, \calF \tensor \calF') = \frob(\bar{z}, \calF) \frob(\bar{z}, \calF')$$
                    \item Let $f: Y \to Z$ be a morphism between $\F_q$-schemes that are locally of finite type and let $\calF$ be an $\ell$-adic local system of rank $1$ on $Z$. Then the following diagram commutes\footnote{To prove that the diagram indeed commutes, recall also the basic sheaf-theoretic fact that for any geometric point $\bar{y} \in Y(\bar{\F}_q)$ over a fixed geometric point $\bar{z} \in Z(\bar{F}_q)$ (i.e. such that $f_{\bar{\F}_q}(\bar{y}) = \bar{z}$), one has an isomorphism $(f^*\calF)_{f_{\bar{\F}_q}(\bar{y})} \cong \calF_{\bar{z}}$ of stalks.}:
                        $$
                            \begin{tikzcd}
                            	{Y(\bar{\F}_q)} && {Z(\bar{\F}_q)} \\
                            	& {\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}
                            	\arrow["{\frob(-, \calF)}", from=1-3, to=2-2]
                            	\arrow["{\frob(-, f^*\calF)}"', from=1-1, to=2-2]
                            	\arrow["{f_{\bar{\F}_q}}", from=1-1, to=1-3]
                            \end{tikzcd}
                        $$
                \end{itemize}
        \end{remark}
        \begin{convention}[Global function field of $X$] \label{conv: global_function_field}
            Let us write $K_X$ for the global function field of $X$ (i.e the stalk of the structure sheaf of $X$ at the unique generic point), $\bbO_X$ for its ring of integers, and $\A_X$ for the corresponding ring of ad\`eles. For more details on these constructions, we refer the reader to \cite[Section VI.1]{neukirch_2010_algebraic_number_theory}. 
        \end{convention}
        \begin{lemma}[The Lang isogeny] \label{lemma: lang_isogeny}
            If $G$ is a connected and smooth algebraic group over $\Spec \F_q$ then there will exist a surjective topological group homomorphism $q_G: \pi_1(G_{\fet}) \to G(\F_q)$.
        \end{lemma}
            \begin{proof}
                The strategy is to make use of corollary \ref{remark: geometric_galois_correspondence}, since $G(\F_q)$ is finite and therefore corresponds uniquely to the quotient of $\pi_1(G_{\fet})$ by a normal subgroup of finite index. For that, we shall need to construct a Galois covering of $G$ with which to compute $\pi_1(G_{\fet})$; this turns out to be the \textbf{Lang isogeny} $l_G: G \to G$, which is defined by $l_G(g) := \Frob_G(g)g^{-1}$. For more details, see \cite[Theorem 4.4.17]{springer_linear_algebraic_groups}.
            \end{proof}
        \begin{proposition}[Grothendieck's Sheaf-Function Correspondence] \label{prop: sheaf_function_correspondence}
            For each $\xi \in \Rep^1_{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}(G(\F_q))^{\cont}$ there exists $\tilde{\xi} \in \Rep^1_{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}(\pi_1(G_{\fet}))^{\cont}$ such that $\tilde{\xi} := \xi \circ q_G$ (with $q_G$ as in lemma \ref{lemma: lang_isogeny}), which corresponds to some $\calF^{\xi} \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(G)$ by theorem \ref{theorem: galois_representations_are_local_systems}. We claim that $\frob(-, \calF^{\xi}) = \xi$ as continuous $\ell$-adic characters of $G(\F_q)$.
        \end{proposition}
            \begin{proof}
                Since the stalk $\calF^{\xi}_{\bar{z}}$ at any geometric point $\bar{z} \in G(\bar{\F}_q)$ is a $1$-dimensional vector space over an algebraically closed field (namely $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$), so according to Schur's Lemma (cf. \cite[Lemma 3.6, pp. 35]{lam_first_course_in_noncommutative_rings}), the Frobenius endomorphism $\Frob_{\bar{z}}^{\flat}: \calF^{\xi}_{\bar{z}} \to \calF^{\xi}_{\bar{z}}$ acts via scalar multiplication by some element $\lambda_{\bar{z}} \in \bar{\Q}_{\ell}^{\x}$. Since the value of the trace of an endomorphism does not depend on any choice of basis, the value of the scalar $\lambda_{\bar{z}}$ is precisely $\frob(\bar{z}, \calF^{\xi})$. Now, pick an arbitrary point $y \in G(\F_q)$ and let $z = l_G(y) = \Frob_G(y)y^{-1}$; such points satsify $\xi(\Frob_G(y)) = \xi(zy) = \xi(z) \xi(y)$, which tells us that 
            \end{proof}
        \begin{lemma}[\'Etale fundamental group of Jacobians] \label{lemma: etale_fundamental_groups_of_jacobians}
            For $X$ as in convention \ref{conv: automorphic_side_conventions}, one has $\pi_1^{\ab}(X_{\fet}) \cong \pi_1(( \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(0)}(X) )_{\fet})$. 
        \end{lemma}
            \begin{proof}
                
            \end{proof}
        \begin{theorem}[Hecke characters from Hecke eigensheaves] \label{theorem: hecke_characters}
            There is a canonical isomorphism between the group of Hecke eigensheaves of rank $1$ on $\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)$ and that of continuous $\ell$-adic characters of $\GL_1(K_X)\backslash\GL_1(\A_X)/\GL_1(\bbO_{X})$, so-called $\ell$-adic \textbf{Hecke characters}:
                $$\Eig\Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^1(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)) \cong \scrA_{\GL_1}(X)$$
        \end{theorem}
            \begin{proof}
                Suppose that we are willing to take the special case of the Weil Uniformisation Theorem for $\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)$ (cf. \cite[Proposition 3.8]{tendler_2015_geometric_class_field_theory}\footnote{For details on Weil Uniformisation for $\Bun_G(X)$, with $G$ being a general connected reductive group, see \cite{sorger_BunG_uniformisation}}) for granted, which states that there is a group isomorphism $\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)(\F_q) \cong \GL_1(K_X)\backslash\GL_1(\A_X)/\GL_1(\bbO_{X})$. First of all, observe that thanks to proposition \ref{prop: sheaf_function_correspondence}, for any $\xi \in \scrA_{\GL_1}(X)$, there exists $\calF^{\xi} \in \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(0)}(X))$ such that $\frob(-, \calF^{\xi}) = \xi$, so for every point $z \in \Bun_{\GL_1}^{(0)}(X)(\F_q)$, $\frob(z, -)$ is a surjective function on the set of isomorphism classes of $\ell$-adic local systems of rank $1$ on $\Bun_{\GL_1}^{(0)}(X)$. Next, note that by 
            \end{proof}
        
        Before we can conclude with Artin's Reciprocity Law for global function fields over finite fields, we will need to understand what it means for $\ell$-adic local systems to be \textbf{Weil sheaves} beforehand, as we are interested in how the Frobenius element of $\Gal(K^{\ab}/K)$ behaves under Artin Reciprocity.
        \begin{definition}[Weil sheaves] \label{def: weil_sheaves}
            Let $k$ be an algebraically closed (hence perfect) field of characteristic $p > 0$. The category of $\ell$-adic \textbf{Weil sheaves} of rank $1$ on a scheme $Z$ that is locally of finite type over $\Spec k$ is the full subcategory of $\Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(Z)$ on which the pullback functor $\Frob_Z^*: \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(Z) \to \Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(Z)$ is an equivalence\footnote{In other words, we can think of Weil sheaves as Frobenius-fixed $\ell$-adic local systems.}, and we suggestively denote it by $\Shv_{\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}}^{\ad, 1}(Z)^{\Frob}$.
        \end{definition}
        \begin{theorem}[Artin Reciprocity for global function fields] \label{theorem: artin_reciprocity_for_global_function_fields}
            There exists a canonical group isomorphism as below, such that for all places $v$ of $K$, one has $\chi(\Frob_v) = \xi(\varpi_v)$:
                $$\scrA_{\GL_1}(X) \cong \Rep^1_{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}(\Gal(K^{\ab}/K))^{\cont}$$
                $$\xi \mapsto \chi$$
        \end{theorem}
            \begin{proof}
                The existence of a canonical group isomorphism as stated comes directly from a combination of corollary \ref{coro: geometric_langlands_for_GL1} and theorem \ref{theorem: hecke_characters}, so let us focus on the \say{Frobenius-compatibility} condition $\chi(\Frob_v) = \xi(\varpi_v)$.
            \end{proof}
