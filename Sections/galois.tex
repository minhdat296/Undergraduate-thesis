        \subsubsection{Construction of \'etale fundamental groups}
            \'Etale fundamental groups of schemes as in \cite[Expos\'e V]{SGA1} are constructed using so-called \textbf{finite Galois categories}: in particular, for any fixed scheme $X$, the category of finite \'etale $X$-schemes is an instance of a finite Galois category, for whom the fundamental group is the group of natural automorphisms of the \textbf{fibre functor} based at a geometric point $\bar{x} \in X$:
                $$\Fib_{\bar{x}}: (\Sch_{/X})_{\fet} \to \Fin\Sets$$
                $$Y \mapsto Y(\bar{x})$$
            Below shall be a brief discussion of the construction (remark \ref{remark: finite_etale_schemes}) and key properties of \'etale fundamental groups of schemes (propositions \ref{prop: etale_fundamental_groups_do_not_depend_on_base_points} and \ref{prop: etale_homotopy_exact_sequence}), accompanied by certain relevant examples (cf. examples \ref{example: etale_fundamental_group_of_a_field} and \ref{example: etale_fundamental_group_of_a_curve}). For the sake of brevity, we have delegated the fine technicalities of this construction to \cite{MATH525_covering_spaces_and_fundamental_group_project}. The reader might also wish to consult \cite[Expos\'e V]{SGA1}, which was where \'etale fundamental groups of schemes were first discussed, as well as the more modern account in \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BQ6}{Tag 0BQ6}]{stacks}.
            
            We begin with the notion of finite Galois categories. Heuristically speaking, these are categories which are equivalent to $\pi\-\Fin\Sets$, the category of finite sets with actions of some profinite group $\pi$, which as we shall see, serves as the \say{fundamental group} of its associated finite Galois category. Due to this phenomenon, the fundamental group of a Galois category serves the same purpose as the classical fundamental groups of topological spaces, that being as a topological invariant. 
            \begin{definition}[Finite Galois categories] \label{def: finite_galois_categories}
                \noindent
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{(Finite Galois categories):} A \textbf{finite Galois category} is defined via the data contained in a pair $(\calG, F)$ consisting of:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item a \textit{finitely complete and finitely cocomplete} small category $\calG$, wherein objects can all be written as finite coproducts of \textit{connected} objects\footnote{Objects $Y \in \calG$ such that the copresheaf $h^Y: \calG \to \Sets$ preserves all coproducts.}, and
                        \item a \textit{pro-representable} functor $F: \calG \to \Fin\Sets$, called the \textbf{fibre functor}, which we shall require to be exact and to reflect isomorphisms.
                    \end{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{(Galois objects):} An object $Y$ of a finite Galois category $\calG$ is a \textbf{Galois object} if and only if $Y/\Aut(Y)$ is terminal as an object of $\calG$ (which exists as $\calG$ is finitely complete by definition).
                    \item \textbf{(Galois functors):} A \textbf{Galois functor} is an exact functor $\Phi: \calG \to \calG'$ between finite Galois categories $(\calG, F), (\calG', F')$ which preserves connected objects and commute with the fibre functors in the following manner:
                        $$
                            \begin{tikzcd}
                            	\calG && {\calG'} \\
                            	& \Fin\Sets
                            	\arrow["F"', from=1-1, to=2-2]
                            	\arrow["{F'}", from=1-3, to=2-2]
                            	\arrow["\Phi", from=1-1, to=1-3]
                            \end{tikzcd}
                        $$
                \end{itemize}
            \end{definition}
            \begin{definition}[Fundamental groups of finite Galois categories] \label{def: fundamental_groups_of_finite_galois_categories}
                The \textbf{fundamental group} of a given finite Galois category $(\calG, F)$, denoted by $\pi_1(\calG, F)$, is defined to be $\Aut(F)$.
            \end{definition}
            \begin{proposition}[Fundamental groups of finite Galois categories are profinite] \label{prop: fundamental_groups_of_finite_galois_categories_are_profinite}
                The fundamental group of any finite Galois category is profinite. In fact, given a finite Galois category $(\calG, F)$, its fundamental group arises as the limit of the cofiltered diagram $\{\Aut(F(Y_i))\}_{i \in \calI}$, where $\calI$ is any cofinal diagram of Galois objects in $\calG$.
            \end{proposition}
            \begin{proposition}[The Finite Galois Correspondence] \label{prop: finite_categorical_galois_correspondence}
                \footnote{See also: \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BN4}{Tag 0BN4}]{stacks}.}\cite[Theorem 1.1.1]{MATH525_covering_spaces_and_fundamental_group_project} For any finite Galois category $(\calG, F)$, the functor $F: \calG \to \pi_1(\calG, F)\-\Fin\Sets$ is a Galois equivalence (we equip the latter with the forgetful functor to $\Fin\Sets$).
            \end{proposition}
            
            Now, the \'etale fundamental group is literally the fundamental group of a Galois category by construction. Namely, it is the fundamental group of the finite Galois category of pointed schemes that are finite \'etale over a pointed base scheme $(X, \bar{x})$ (cf. remark \ref{remark: finite_etale_schemes}). This, however, is not the only interesting feature that the \'etale fundamental group displays; one of the main reason why Grothendieck's \'etale fundamental group gained attention in the first place is that by taking the \'etale fundamental group of an algebraic variety, one actually obtains the absolute Galois of the global function field of said variety. As such, the \'etale fundamental group is a great tool that we can make use of in order to understand Galois groups; in fact, even the use of finite \'etale morphisms has a very concrete field-theoretic reason (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00U3}{Tag 00U3}]{stacks}).
            
            Let us also note that because any topological space with a generic point is contractible \textit{a priori}, and since most interesting schemes (such as varieties) are integral and hence have generic points\footnote{This is more or less due to the fact that the zero ideal is prime in integral domains. For more details, see \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01IS}{Tag 01IS}]{stacks}.}, the usual topological fundamental group is very unlikely to be able to distinguish the underlying topological spaces of two different schemes. Furthermore, because schemes are actually determined by their structure sheaves as opposed to their underlying topological spaces (e.g. if $\Nil(R)$ denotes the nilradical of a commutative ring then $\Spec R$ and $\Spec R/\Nil(R)$ will be non-isomorphic schemes whose underlying topological spaces are homeomorphic), we should not expect the topological fundamental group to be able to tell two schemes apart from one another. This is not to mention that in most cases, the underlying topological space of a scheme is not path-connected, so a fundamental group defined as the group of homotopy equivalence class of loops would not have made much sense.
            
            At the end of the section on Grothendieck's \'etale fundamental group, we will be giving several arithmetically interesting examples which we shall be making use of throughout the entirety of this thesis (notably, in corollary \ref{coro: unramified_galois_representations_induced_by_the_abel_jacobi_map}), such as computations of the \'etale fundamental groups of the prime spectrum of a field and the projective line $\P^1$.
            \begin{remark}[Finite-\'etale schemes] \label{remark: finite_etale_schemes}
                For any given by scheme $X$, the small category $(\Sch_{/X})_{\fet}$ of finite-\'etale $X$-schemes is a category wherein:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item all finite limits and all finite colimits exist, and
                        \item all objects can be written as a (possibly empty) finite coproduct of connected objects, which happen to be schemes that are \'etale over $X$.  
                    \end{itemize}
                (for a detailed proof, see \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BN9}{Tag 0BN9}]{stacks}) so should we be able to define a fibre functor $(\Sch_{/X})_{\fet} \to \Fin\Sets$, we will have succeeded in putting a finite Galois category structure on $(\Sch_{/X})_{\fet}$. As a matter of fact, such a well-defined fibre functor has good reasons to exist: it is an easy consequence of \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00U3}{Tag 00U3}]{stacks} that for any fixed geometric point $\bar{x} \in X$ (corresponding to an algebraic closure\footnote{Certain sources consider geometric points to correspond to separable closures. For us, however, geometric points are algebraically closed fields $K$ so that $\Spec K$ be a Galois object of $(\Sch_{/\Spec K})_{\fet}$. In practice this choice usually does not matter, since we will mostly work over perfect field, and separable closures of perfect fields are algebraically closed.} $\bar{\kappa}_x$ of the residue field of $x \in X$), one has:
                    $$(\Spec \bar{\kappa}_x)_{\fet} \cong \Fin\Sets$$
                (the forward direct simply involves taking the underlying set, and the inverse functors is given by $I \mapsto \coprod_{i = 1}^{|I|} \Spec \bar{\kappa}_x$) and so for any $k$-scheme $X$, one has the following canonical defined functor:
                    $$(\Sch_{/X})_{\fet} \to (\Sch_{/\Spec \bar{\kappa}_x})$$
                    $$Y \mapsto Y_{\bar{x}}$$
                where $Y_{\bar{x}} \cong Y \x_X \Spec \bar{\kappa}_x$; one can then take the underlying set of $Y_{\bar{x}}$ to get the following trivially left-exact\footnote{... and hence pro-representable (cf. \cite[Proposition 3.1]{grothendieck_fga_2}).} functor:
                    $$\Fib_{\bar{x}}: (\Sch_{/X})_{\fet} \to \Fin\Sets$$
                    $$Y \mapsto |Y_{\bar{x}}|$$
                We should also verify that the sets $|Y_{\bar{x}}|$ are indeed finite. To this end, let us first apply the fact that pullbacks of \'etale morphisms are \'etale to see that if $Y$ is affine over $X$ then $Y_{\bar{x}}$ will have to be the spectrum of an \'etale $\bar{\kappa}_x$-algebra; however, according to \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00U3}{Tag 00U3}]{stacks}, this means that $Y_{\bar{x}} \cong \Spec (\bar{\kappa}_x)^{\oplus N}$ for some finite $N$. The locality of \'etale-ness and the finiteness of $Y$ as an $X$-scheme then tells us that in general, $Y_{\bar{x}}$ must be a finite disjoint union of affine schemes of the form $\Spec (\bar{\kappa}_x)^{\oplus N}$, meaning that $Y_{\bar{x}} \cong \Spec (\bar{\kappa}_x)^{\oplus N'}$ for some finite $N'$. The set $|Y_{\bar{x}}|$ is therefore always finite. One also sees that an immediate consequence of this proof is that $\Fib_{\bar{x}}$ necessarily \textit{reflects isomorphisms} and is \textit{right-exact}. 
            \end{remark}
            
            The discussion above allows us to make the following important definition.
            \begin{definition}[\'Etale fundamental groups] \label{def: etale_fundamental_groups}
                For any scheme $X$ with a fixed geometric point $\bar{x}$, the pair $((\Sch_{/X})_{\fet}, \Fib_{\bar{x}})$ as in remark \ref{remark: finite_etale_schemes} defines a finite Galois category in the sense of \cite[Section 1]{MATH525_covering_spaces_and_fundamental_group_project}. Its fundamental group is commonly denoted by $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x})$ and called the \textbf{\'etale fundamental group} of $X$ based at $\bar{x}$.
            \end{definition}
            
            We can then apply proposition \ref{prop: finite_categorical_galois_correspondence} directly to get the following topological characterisation of connected schemes via their \'etale fundamental groups.
            \begin{theorem}[The Geometric Galois Correspondence] \label{theorem: geometric_galois_correspondence}
                For $(X, \bar{x})$ a pointed connected scheme, the functor $\Fib_{\bar{x}}: (\Sch_{/X})_{\fet} \to \Fin\Sets$ as in remark \ref{remark: finite_etale_schemes} above is a Galois equivalence of finite Galois categories. 
            \end{theorem}
            \begin{corollary}
                Should $H$ be a finite-index (hence open, since $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x})$ is profinite \textit{a priori}; cf. proposition \ref{prop: fundamental_groups_of_finite_galois_categories_are_profinite}) normal subgroup of $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x})$ and $(X^H, \bar{x}^H)$ be the corresponding Galois $X$-scheme with a choice of base point $\bar{x}^H$ lying over $\bar{x}$, then $\pi_1(X^H_{\fet}, \bar{x}^H) \cong H$. In fact, for any connected pointed scheme $(X, \bar{x})$, there is an equivalence of categories:
                    $$\{\text{Finite \'etale $X$-schemes $Y$ with base points $\bar{y}$ lying over $\bar{x}$}\}$$
                    $$\cong$$
                    $$\{\text{Finite-index subgroups of $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x})$}\}$$
                which restricts down to:
                    $$\{\text{Finite \'etale Galois $X$-schemes $Y$ with base points $\bar{y}$ lying over $\bar{x}$}\}$$
                    $$\cong$$
                    $$\{\text{Finite-index \textit{normal} subgroups of $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x})$}\}$$
            \end{corollary}
            \begin{example}[The \'etale fundamental group of a field] \label{example: etale_fundamental_group_of_a_field}
                As a sanity check, note that if $K$ is a field then finite-\'etale Galois schemes over $\Spec K$ shall be of the form $\Spec L \to \Spec K$, where $L/K$ is a finite Galois extension, and as a consequence, there are the following equivalences of categories\footnote{In fact, these categories are lattices with meets being intersections of fields/subgroups and joins being the constructions of composite fields/subgroups.}, which demonstrate that theorem \ref{theorem: geometric_galois_correspondence} directly generalises the classical Galois Correspondence:
                    $$\{\text{Finite-index normal subgroups of $\pi_1((\Spec K)_{\fet})$}\}$$
                    $$\cong$$
                    $$\{\text{Finite \'etale Galois schemes over $\Spec K$}\}$$
                    $$\cong$$
                    $$\{\text{Finite Galois extensions of $K$}\}^{\op}$$
                    $$\cong$$
                    $$\{\text{Finite-index normal subgroups of $\Gal(\bar{K}/K)$}\}$$
            \end{example}
            \begin{example}[The \'etale fundamental group of a curve] \label{example: etale_fundamental_group_of_a_curve}
                Let $k$ be a field. If $X$ is a connected non-singular projective curve over $\Spec k$ with function field $K$, then there is a canonical equivalence between the categories of finite Galois extensions of $K$ and finite \'etale Galois $X$-schemes, which are precisely dominant rational maps whose associated function field extensions are Galois thanks to proposition \ref{prop: curves_and_function_fields}. Through this, it is easy to see that:
                    $$\pi_1(X_{\fet}) \cong \Gal(\bar{K}/K)$$
                For instance, we have:
                    $$\pi_1((\P^1_k)_{\fet}) \cong \Gal(\bar{k}/k)$$
                (since the function field of $\P^1_k$ is $k(t)$), which tells us that $\P^1_k$ is simply \'etale-connected if and only if $k$ is algebraically closed (since $\Gal(\bar{k}/k)$ is \textit{a fortiori} trivial in that case). 
            \end{example}
        
        \subsubsection{Properties of \'etale fundamental groups}
            Now, let us make sure that the \'etale fundamental group $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x})$ as defined in definition \ref{def: etale_fundamental_groups} is meaningful as a formal construction. Namely, we would like to know the behaviours of $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x})$ when we change the base point and when we base-change (cf. proposition \ref{prop: etale_fundamental_groups_do_not_depend_on_base_points}), as well as whether or not \'etale fibrations induce homotopy exact sequences of fundamental groups (cf. proposition \ref{prop: etale_homotopy_exact_sequence}). 
            \begin{proposition}[\'Etale fundamental group do not depend on base points] \label{prop: etale_fundamental_groups_do_not_depend_on_base_points}
                \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BQA}{Tag 0BQA}]{stacks} Let $f: Y \to X$ be a morphism of connected qcqs\footnote{quasi-compact and quasi-separated} schemes such that the base change functor $X' \mapsto X' \x_X Y$ is an equivalence of Galois categories between $(\Sch_{/X})_{\fet}$ and $(\Sch_{/Y})_{\fet}$. Then, for any choice of geometric points $\bar{x} \in X$ and $\bar{y} \in Y$, one has the following isomorphism of \'etale fundamental groups $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x}) \cong \pi_1(Y_{\fet}, \bar{y})$.
            \end{proposition}
            \begin{corollary}[Uniqueness of \'etale fundamental groups] \label{coro: etale_fundamental_group_uniqueness}
                For any connected qcqs scheme $X$ and any pair of possibly distinct geometric points $\bar{x}, \bar{x}' \in X$, one has any isomorphism of \'etale fundamental groups $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x}) \cong \pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x}')$, and therefore it makes sense to only speak of \textit{the} fundamental group of $X$, which we shall denote by $\pi_1(X_{\fet})$.
            \end{corollary}
            
            \begin{proposition}[The \'etale homotopy exact sequence] \label{prop: etale_homotopy_exact_sequence}
                \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C0J}{Tag 0C0J}]{stacks} Let $X$ be a connected scheme. If $f: Y \to X$ be a flat proper morphism of finite presentation whose geometric fibres $Y_{\bar{x}}$ are connected and reduced, then for any geometric point $\bar{x} \in X$, there exists a right-exact sequence of groups as follows:
                    $$\pi_1((Y_{\bar{x}})_{\fet}) \to \pi_1(Y_{\fet}) \to \pi_1(X_{\fet}) \to 1$$
            \end{proposition}
    
    \subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\ell$}{}-adic sheaves and Grothendieck's Galois Theory}
        The process of geometrising class field theory begins with the geometrisation of Galois representations, which thanks to a combination of proposition \ref{prop: curves_and_function_fields} and theorem \ref{theorem: geometric_galois_correspondence} are more or less the same as representations of \'etale fundamental groups of schemes. As such, we seek a geometrisation of representations of \'etale fundamental groups and this will be done via establishing a connection between said representations and a certain kind of abelian sheaves - called \textbf{lisse $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$-adic sheaves} - on \say{the curve of global class field theory} (cf. convention \ref{conv: automorphic_side_conventions}); our efforts shall culminate in theorem \ref{theorem: galois_representations_are_lisse_sheaves}. In addition, we shall be collecting several facts about the algebra of lisse $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$-adic sheaves for later use. In particular, we want to keep in mind that lisse $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$-adic sheaves behave well around tensor products as well as pullbacks and pushforwards.  
    
        \subsubsection{Artin-Rees categories and adic sheaves}
            We begin by building our way up to the notion of \textbf{lisse $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$-adic sheaves}, which are essential for the statement of the main theorem of this section, namely theorem \ref{theorem: galois_representations_are_lisse_sheaves}. For subtle technical reasons, this involves some abstraction in the form of so-called \textbf{Artin-Rees categories}, which are direct generalisations of categories of adically complete modules over Noetherian rings. Our main reference is \cite[Subsection 1.4]{conrad_etale_cohomology} and \cite[Expos\'e V]{sga5}, which was where the constructions below first appeared.
        
            \begin{definition}[Artin-Rees categories] \label{def: artin_rees_categories}
                The \textbf{Artin-Rees category} associated to an abelian category $\calA$ is the full subcategory of $\calA_{\bullet} := \Pro(\calA)$ spanned by cofiltered diagrams $\{M_n\}_{n \in \Z}$; we denote it by $\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR}$. Of particular interest are the so-called \textbf{null systems}, which are objects $\{M_n\}_{n \in \Z} \in \calA_{\bullet}^{\AR}$ such that there exists $\nu \in \N$ so that for all $n \in \Z$ the morphism $M_n \to M_{n + \nu}$ is zero.
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{proposition}[Artin-Rees categories are linear and abelian] \label{prop: artin_rees_categories_are_linear_and_abelian}
                \cite[Expos\'e V, Propositions 2.2.2 et 2.4.1]{sga5} For any (locally finite) $\Lambda$-linear\footnote{I.e. if hom-sets of $\calA$ are (locally finite) $\Lambda$-modules (e.g. when $\calA \cong \Lambda\mod$).} abelian category $\calA$, the associated Artin-Rees category $\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR}$ is also a (locally finite) $\Lambda$-linear abelian category, with zero objects being the null systems. In fact, the Artin-Rees category $\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR}$ is the localisation\footnote{In the sense of \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/02MS}{Tag 02MS}]{stacks}.} of $\calA_{\bullet}$ at the thick\footnote{Cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/02MO}{Tag 02MO}]{stacks}.} subcategory of null systems, meaning that an isomorphism in $\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR}$ (henceforth referred to as an \textbf{AR-isomorphism}) is a morphism in $\calA_{\bullet}$ whose kernel and cokernel are null. 
            \end{proposition}
            
            \begin{convention}[The setting for adic sheaves] \label{conv: l_adic_sheaves_conventions}
                For our purposes, $\calX$ shall be a scheme that is locally of finite type\footnote{Althought $\calX$ might actually be an algebraic stack of finite type over $S$; for details, see \cite{laszlo_olsson_adic_sheaves_on_artin_stacks_1} and \cite{laszlo_olsson_adic_sheaves_on_artin_stacks_2}. It should also be noted that in \cite[Subsection 1.4]{conrad_etale_cohomology}, it was only required that $\calX$ would be Noetherian, which is not sufficient for us, as $\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)$ is merely locally of finite type, and hence only locally Noetherian \textit{a priori}.} over a base scheme $S$ that is affine, regular, Noetherian\footnote{Note that this implies that $\calX$ is locally Noetherian (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01T6}{Tag 01T6}]{stacks}).} and of dimension $\leq 1$, and of characteristic $p \geq 0$; moreoever, we would like to work under the assumption that every finite-type $S$-scheme $T$ is also of finite cohomological dimension. In addition, $\Lambda$ shall be a discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic $(0, \ell)$ (for some auxiliary prime $\ell \not = p$) with maximal ideal $\m$, and fraction field $E$.

            \begin{definition}[Torsion objects in tensor categories] \label{def: torsion_objects_in_tensor_categories}
                Let $A$ be a commutative ring, $I$ be an ideal of $A$, and $\calA$ be an $A$-linear category. Then, the subcategory of $\calA$ spanned by $I$-torsion objects is the one wherein the hom-sets are $\Hom_{\calA/I}(M, N) \cong \Hom_\calA(M, N) \tensor_A A/I$.
            \end{definition}
            \begin{definition}[Adic objects and lisse objects of Artin-Rees categories] \label{def: adic_objects_and_lisse_objects_of_artin_rees_categories}
                Consider the Artin-Rees category $\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR}$ associated to a locally finite $\Lambda$-linear abelian category $\calA$. 
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item \textbf{(Adic objects):} $\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR}$ admits a full subcategory, denoted by $\calA_{\bullet}^{\ad}$, whose objects $\{M_n\}_{n \in \Z}$ are such that:
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item $M_n \cong 0$ for all $n < 0$,
                                \item $M_n$ is $\m^{n + 1}$-torsion for all $n \geq 0$, and
                                \item the canonical maps $\Lambda/\m^{n + 2} \tensor_{\Lambda} \Hom_{\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR}}(M_{\bullet}, N_{\bullet}) \to \Hom_{\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR}}(M_{\bullet}, N_{\bullet})/\m^n$ are isomorphisms of $\Lambda/\m^{n + 1}$-modules for all $n \geq 0$.
                            \end{itemize}
                        Objects of this full subcategory are said to be \textbf{$\m$-adic}.
                        \item \textbf{(Lisse objects):} Let $\calA_{\bullet}^{\fin}$ denote the category of Artin-Rees projective systems of objects of $\calA$ which are simultaneously Artinian and Noetherian. Objects of the category\footnote{Here, the intersection is understood to be at both the level of objects and that of morphisms.} $\calA_{\bullet}^{\lisse} := \calA_{\bullet}^{\ad} \cap \calA_{\bullet}^{\fin}$ are then said to be \textbf{lisse}. 
                    \end{enumerate}
            \end{definition}
            \begin{proposition}[Adic categories are linear and abelian] \label{prop: adic_categories_are_linear_and_abelian}
                Let $\calA$ be a locally finite $\Lambda$-linear abelian category. Then, we shall have a tower $\calA_{\bullet}^{\lisse} \subset \calA_{\bullet}^{\ad} \subset \calA_{\bullet}^{\AR}$ of locally finite $\Lambda$-linear abelian categories, wherein the inclusions are fully faithful exact functors.
            \end{proposition}
            \begin{example}[Adic and lisse $\Lambda$-sheaves] \label{example: adic_sheaves}
                Recall first of all that the category of constructible \'etale sheaves of $\Lambda$-modules on a Noetherian scheme - of which the category $\Lambda\mod^{\cons}(\calX_{\et})$ of constructible sheaves of $\Lambda$-modules on $\calX_{\et}$ is a special case - is a locally finite $\Lambda$-linear closed monoidal category (to see why, combine \cite[Propositions 3.20 and 3.22]{behrend_l_adic_sheaves_for_algebraic_stacks}). Then, the category of adic constructible $\m$-adic sheaves on $\calX$ (also called constructible $\Lambda$-sheaves), commonly denoted by $\Shv_{\Lambda}^{\ad}(\calX)$, is nothing but $\Lambda\mod^{\cons}(\calX_{\et})_{\bullet}^{\ad}$, and the category of lisse $\m$-adic sheaves on $\calX$, denoted by $\Shv_{\Lambda}^{\lisse}(\calX)$ is simply $\Lambda\mod^{\cons}(\calX_{\et})_{\bullet}^{\lisse}$.
            \end{example}
            
            \begin{definition}[$E$-objects] \label{def: E_objects}
                Let $\calA$ be a locally finite $\Lambda$-linear abelian category. Then, we can define the associated category of \textbf{$E$-objects} to be the localisation $\calA \tensor_{\Lambda} E$ at $E$-linear morphisms, i.e. we define:
                    $$\Hom_{\calA \tensor_{\Lambda} E}(M, N) \cong \Hom_{\calA}(M, N) \tensor_{\Lambda} E$$
                It can be easily verified that $\calA \tensor_{\Lambda} E$ is locally finite $E$-linear and abelian.
            \end{definition}
            \begin{definition}[$\bar{E}$-objects] \label{def: bar_E_objects}
                Let $\calA$ be a locally finite $\Lambda$-linear abelian category. We define the associated category $\calA \tensor_{\Lambda} \bar{E}$ of \textbf{$\bar{E}$-objects} via:
                    $$\Hom_{\calA \tensor_{\Lambda} \bar{E}}(M, N) \cong \underset{\text{$E'/E$ finite extensions}}{\colim} \Hom_{\calA}(M, N) \tensor_{\Lambda} E'$$
                Using the fact that associated categories of $E$-objects are abelian and $E$-linear, one can show that associated categories of $\bar{E}$-objects are abelian and $\bar{E}$-linear\footnote{The one technicality to keep in mind is that for finite-dimensional vector spaces, filtered colimits commute with kernels.}. 
            \end{definition}
            \begin{example}[Adic and lisse $E$-sheaves and $\bar{E}$-sheaves] \label{example: E_sheaves}
                Because $\Shv_{\Lambda}^{\ad}(\calX)$ and $\Shv_{\Lambda}^{\lisse}(\calX)$ are locally finite $\Lambda$-linear and abelian (cf. proposition \ref{prop: adic_categories_are_linear_and_abelian}), one can define the categories of constructible adic $E$-sheaves and that of lisse $E$-sheaves on $\calX$ to be $\Shv_E^{\ad}(\calX) \cong \Shv_{\Lambda}^{\ad}(\calX) \tensor_{\Lambda} E$ and $\Shv_E^{\lisse}(\calX) \cong \Shv_{\Lambda}^{\lisse}(\calX) \tensor_{\Lambda} E$. Adic and lisse $\bar{E}$-sheaves can thus also be defined.
            \end{example}
            
        \subsubsection{Operations with adic sheaves}
            The following results shall be used throughout the rest of the paper without any explicit mention (that is, with the notable exception of theorem \ref{theorem: galois_representations_are_lisse_sheaves}). For details, we refer the reader to \cite[Sections 6-8]{laszlo_olsson_adic_sheaves_on_artin_stacks_2} (which is a sequel to \cite{laszlo_olsson_adic_sheaves_on_artin_stacks_1}) and \cite[Sections II.7-II.10]{kiehl_weissauer_weil_conjecture_perverse_sheaves_and_l_adic_fourier_transform}.
            
            \begin{proposition}[Tensor products of constructible adic objects] \label{prop: tensor_products_of_constructible_adic_objects}
                \noindent
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item \cite[Proposition 6.1]{laszlo_olsson_adic_sheaves_on_artin_stacks_2} For any locally finite $\Lambda$-linear closed monoidal abelian category $(\calA, \tensor, \1)$, the associated categories $\calA_{\bullet}^{\ad}$ and $\calA_{\bullet}^{\lisse}$ of adic and lisse systems are monoidal with respect to term-wise tensor products $M_{\bullet} \tensor N_{\bullet} \cong \{M_n \tensor N_n\}_{n \in \Z}$. In fact, they both embed via fully faithful monoidal exact $\Lambda$-linear functors into $\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR}$, which is also monoidal with respect to term-wise tensor products. 
                    \item \cite[Theorem III.12.2 and Appendix A]{kiehl_weissauer_weil_conjecture_perverse_sheaves_and_l_adic_fourier_transform} Furthermore, $\calA_{\bullet}^{\ad}$ and $\calA_{\bullet}^{\lisse}$ (respectively, $\calA_{\bullet}^{\ad} \tensor_{\Lambda} \bar{E}$ and $\calA_{\bullet}^{\lisse} \tensor_{\Lambda} \bar{E}$ for any choice of algebraic closure $\bar{E}/E$) are closed monoidal categories with respect to these tensor products.
                \end{enumerate}
            \end{proposition}
            \begin{example}[Tensor products of constructible adic sheaves] \label{def: tensor_products_of_constructible_adic_sheaves}
                $\Lambda\mod^{\cons}(\calX_{\et})$ is a locally finite closed monoidal category with respect to tensor products over the constant sheaf $\underline{\Lambda}$ (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/093P}{Tag 093P}]{stacks}), so by proposition \ref{prop: tensor_products_of_constructible_adic_objects}, the category $\Shv_{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}^{\lisse}(\calX)$ of lisse $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$ sheaves on $\calX$ shall be closed monoidal with respect to the constant sheaf $\underline{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}$.
            \end{example}
            
            \begin{proposition}[$*$-pullbacks and $*$-pushforwards] \label{prop: *_pullbacks_and_pushforwards_of_l_adic_sheaves}
                For $f: \calX \to \calY$ a morphism of finite type between $S$-schemes that are locally of finite type (with $S$ as in convention \ref{conv: l_adic_sheaves_conventions}), there is an adjoint equivalence whose components $f^*$ and $f_*$ are computed term-wise as in \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/03PZ}{Tag 03PZ}]{stacks} and  \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/03PV}{Tag 03PV}]{stacks} respectively:
                    $$
                        \begin{tikzcd}
                        	{\Shv_{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}^{\lisse}(\calX)} & {\Shv_{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}^{\lisse}(\calY)}
                        	\arrow[""{name=0, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "{f_*}"', bend right, from=1-1, to=1-2]
                        	\arrow[""{name=1, anchor=center, inner sep=0}, "{f^*}"', bend right, from=1-2, to=1-1]
                        	\arrow["\dashv"{anchor=center, rotate=-90}, draw=none, from=1, to=0]
                        \end{tikzcd}
                    $$
                Furthermore, the funcotrs $f^*$ and $f_*$ both commute with (external) tensor products of lisse $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$-sheaves.
            \end{proposition}
                \begin{proof}
                    Combine \cite[Proposition 8.3]{laszlo_olsson_adic_sheaves_on_artin_stacks_2} with \cite[Theorem II.7.1]{kiehl_weissauer_weil_conjecture_perverse_sheaves_and_l_adic_fourier_transform}
                \end{proof}
            
            \begin{definition}[Stalks of constructible adic sheaves] \label{def: stalks_of_constructible_adic_sheaves}
                \cite[Definition 1.4.4.3]{conrad_etale_cohomology} Let $\bar{x} \in \calX$ be a geometric point and $\calF_{\bullet} \in \Shv_{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}^{\ad}(\calX)$ be a constructible $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$-sheaf on $\calX$. Then, the \textbf{stalk} at $\bar{x}$ shall be given by $\underset{n \in \N}{\lim} (\calF_n)_{\bar{x}}$, with each term $(\calF_n)_{\bar{x}}$ being computed as stalks of \'etale sheaves (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/040R}{Tag 040R}]{stacks}).
            \end{definition}
            \begin{remark}
                As tensor products and $*$-pullbacks/pushforwards of lisse $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$ are computed term-wise, taking stalks of lisse $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$-sheaves commutes with those operations.
            \end{remark}
            
            \begin{convention}[Continuous linear representations] \label{conv: continuous_linear_representations}
                From now on, if $G$ is a topological group and $E$ is a topological field then we will be writing $\Rep_E(G)$ for the category of \textit{continuous} $E$-linear representations of $G$. In fact, all representations shall be implicitly assumed to be continuous. Also, for all $n \geq 1$, $\Rep_E^n(G)$ shall be used to denote the subcategory of $n$-dimensional $E$-linear representations of $G$.
            \end{convention}
            \begin{theorem}[Galois representations are lisse $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$-sheaves] \label{theorem: galois_representations_are_lisse_sheaves}
                \cite[Theorem 1.4.5.7]{conrad_etale_cohomology} Let $\calX$ be a connected Noetherian scheme and fix a geometric point $\bar{x} \in \calX$. Then, there exists a monoidal equivalence given by $\calF \mapsto \calF_{\bar{x}}$, from the symmetric monoidal category $\Shv_{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}^{\lisse}(\calX)$ of lisse $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$-sheaves to the symmetric monoidal category $\Rep_{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}^{\fin}(\pi_1(\calX_{\fet}))$ of finite-dimensional continuous $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$-linear representations of $\pi_1(X_{\fet})$.
