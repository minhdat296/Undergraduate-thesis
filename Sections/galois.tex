        \subsubsection{Construction of \'etale fundamental groups}
            Let us begin with an auxiliary notion, that of pro-representable functors, which is necessary for our first important construction, that of Galois categories.
            \begin{definition}[Pro-representable functors] \label{def: pro_representable_functors}
                \noindent
                \begin{enumerate}
                    \item \textbf{(Pro-completions):} Following \cite[Definition 2.1]{isaksen_2001_limits_and_colimits_in_pro_categories}, the \textbf{pro-completion} $\Pro(\C)$ of a small category $\C$ is the category whose objects are cofiltered diagrams in $\C$ and whose hom-sets are given by $\Pro(\C)(\{X_i\}_{i \in \calI}, \{Y_j\}_{j \in \calJ}) \cong \underset{j \in \calJ}{\lim} \underset{i \in \calI}{\colim} \C(X_i, Y_j)$.
                    \item \textbf{(Pro-representable functors):} Let $\C$ be a small category, and suppose that $\C$ is enriched in some small \href{http://nlab-pages.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/nlab/show/closed+monoidal+category}{\underline{closed monoidal category}} $\V$ (e.g. the category of finite sets or the category of sets where the monoidal structure is given by products). Then, a $\V$-presheaf on $\C^{\op}$ is said to be \textbf{pro-representable} if and only if it is naturally isomorphic to a filtered colimit of representable presheaves on $\C^{\op}$.
                \end{enumerate}
            \end{definition}
            \begin{remark} \label{remark: pro_representable_functors_are_ind_objects}
                Observe that due to Yoneda's Lemma, for $\C$ any small category and $\V$ any small closed monoidal category, the category of pro-representable $\V$-presheaves on $\C^{\op}$ is equivalent to $\Pro(\C)^{\op}$.
                
                Additionally, note that any pro-completion of a finite complete small category is necessarily cofiltered, since every finite cone must therefore admit a cone. Furthermore, pro-completions are their own maximal cofinal cofiltered subdiagram.
            \end{remark}
            
            We now officially begin our discussion of Grothendieck's Galois Theory with the notion of Galois categories, axiomatic settings in which one can \say{do Galois theory}, in the sense of classifying subobjects of a given universal object by checking whether or not they remain stable under certain \say{Galois group} actions; the idea is that Galois categories behave similarly to the category of finite sets (which can be thought of as the prototypical Galois category), in the same manner that sheaf topoi resemble the category of sets. Do keep in mind that for the sake of convenience (although without loss of generality, at least for our purposes), definition \ref{def: galois_categories} is a combination of \cite[D\'efinition V.4.5.1]{SGA1} and \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BMY}{Tag 0BMY}]{stacks}; namely, we require that the fibre functor is \textit{pro-representable}, which the latter source does not.
            \begin{definition}[Galois categories and their fundamental groups] \label{def: galois_categories}
                \noindent
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{(Galois categories):} A \textbf{Galois category} is defined via the data contained in a pair $(\calG, F)$ consisting of:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item a \textit{finitely complete and finitely cocomplete} small category $\calG$, wherein objects can all be written as finite coproducts of \textit{connected} objects\footnote{Objects $X \in \calG$ such that the copresheaf $\calG(X, -)$ preserves all coproducts.}.
                        \item a \textit{pro-representable} functor $F: \calG \to \Fin\Sets$ - called the \textbf{fibre functor} - which we shall require to be exact and to reflect isomorphisms (i.e. for all bijections $Fx \cong Fy$ between finite sets, one has an isomorphism $x \cong y$ in $\calG$).
                    \end{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{(Galois objects):} An object $X$ of a Galois category $\calG$ is a \textbf{Galois object} if and only if it has no non-trivial automorphisms, i.e. if and only if $X/\Aut_{\calG}(X) \cong \pt$, with $\pt$ a terminal object of $\calG$.\footnote{Note that Galois categories must have terminal objects, as they are finitely complete and terminal objects are nothing but the limit of the empty diagram (which is finite by virtue of containing no vertices and no edges).}
                    \item \textbf{(Galois functors):} A \textbf{Galois functor} is an exact functor $\Phi: \calG \to \calG'$ between Galois categories $(\calG, F), (\calG', F')$ which preserves connected objects and commute with the fibre functors in the following manner:
                        $$
                            \begin{tikzcd}
                            	\calG && {\calG'} \\
                            	& {\Fin\Sets}
                            	\arrow["F"', from=1-1, to=2-2]
                            	\arrow["{F'}", from=1-3, to=2-2]
                            	\arrow["\Phi", from=1-1, to=1-3]
                            \end{tikzcd}
                        $$
                \end{itemize}
            \end{definition}
            \begin{definition}[Fundamental groups of Galois categories] \label{def: fundamental_groups_of_galois_categories}
                The \textbf{fundamental group} of a given Galois category $(\calG, F)$, denoted by $\pi_1(\calG, F)$, is defined to be the automorphism group $\Aut(\Pro(F))$.
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{proposition}[The Categorical Galois Correspondence] \label{prop: categorical_galois_correspondence}
                For every Galois category $(\calG, F)$, there an equivalence of categories (cf. \cite[Propositions 5.2]{SGA1}):
                    $$\calG \cong \pi_1(\calG, F)\-\Fin\Sets$$
                    $$Y \mapsto F(Y)$$
                Furthermore, one has the following equivalences characterising the relationship between subgroups of the fundamental group $\pi_1(\calG, F)$ and permutations of Galois covers in $\calG$ (cf. \cite[Propositions 5.5]{SGA1}):
                    $$\{\text{Finite-index subgroups of $\pi_1(\calG, F)$}\}^{\op} \cong \pi_1(\calG, F)\-\Fin\Sets$$
                    $$H \mapsto \pi_1(\calG, F)/H$$
                    $$\calG^{\Gal} \cong \{\text{Finite-index normal subgroups of $\pi_1(\calG, F)$}\}$$
            \end{proposition}
                
            \begin{definition}[Universal covers] \label{def: universal_covers}
                Let $(\calG, F)$ be a Galois category. A pro-object $\tilde{X} \in \Pro(\calG)$ is called a \textbf{universal cover} if and only if its fundamental group $\pi_1(\tilde{X}) \cong \Aut(\Pro(F)(\tilde{X}))$ is trivial (i.e. if and only if it is simply-connected).
            \end{definition}
            \begin{remark}[Fundamental groups are automorphism groups of universal covers] \label{remark: fundamental_groups_are_automorphism_groups_of_universal_covers}
                
            \end{remark}
            
            Let us now try to adapt definitions \ref{def: galois_categories} and \ref{def: fundamental_groups_of_galois_categories} to a appropriate categories of schemes, namely those spanned by schemes finite-\'etale over a given base.
            \begin{remark}[\'Etale vs. finite-\'etale] \label{remark: etale_vs_finite_etale}
                One crucial tehcnicality that we will need to keep in mind is that finite-\'etale morphisms are \'etale, but the converse need not be true (e.g. the affine line is \'etale but not at all finite). However, \'etale morphisms are indeed finite when the codomain is the spectrum of a field (this is not the only case where \'etale morphisms are finite-\'etale, but it is sufficient for us); a proof can easily derived from \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00U3}{Tag 00U3}]{stacks}, which asserts that \'etale (commutative) algebras over a field $k$ are isomorphic to finite direct sums of finite separable extension of $k$. 
            \end{remark}
            \begin{remark}[Finite-\'etale schemes] \label{remark: finite_etale_schemes}
                For any given by scheme $X$, the small category $(\Sch_{/X})_{\fet}$ of finite-\'etale $X$-schemes is a category wherein:
                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item all finite limits and all finite colimits exist, and
                        \item all objects can be written as a (possibly empty) finite coproduct of connected objects, which happen to be schemes that are \'etale over $X$.  
                    \end{itemize}
                (for a detailed proof, see \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BN9}{Tag 0BN9}]{stacks}) so should we be able to define a fibre functor $(\Sch_{/X})_{\fet} \to \Fin\Sets$, we will have succeeded in putting a Galois category structure on $(\Sch_{/X})_{\fet}$. As a matter of fact, such a well-defined fibre functor has good reasons to exist: it is an easy consequence of \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00U3}{Tag 00U3}]{stacks} that for any fixed geometric point $\bar{x} \in X$ (corresponding to an algebraic closure $\bar{\kappa}_x$ of the residue field of $x \in X$\footnote{Certain sources consider geometric points to correspond to separable closures. For us, however, geometric points are algebraically closed fields $K$ so that $\Spec K$ be a Galois object of $(\Sch_{/\Spec K})_{\fet}$ (cf. definition \ref{def: galois_categories}). In practice this choice usually does not matter, since we will mostly work over perfect field, and separable closures of perfect fields are algebraically closed.}), one has:
                    $$(\Spec \bar{\kappa}_x)_{\fet} \cong \Fin\Sets$$
                (the forward direct simply involves taking the underlying set, and the inverse functors is given by $I \mapsto \coprod_{i = 1}^{|I|} \Spec \bar{\kappa}_x$) and so for any $k$-scheme $X$, one has the following canonical defined functor:
                    $$(\Sch_{/X})_{\fet} \to (\Sch_{/\Spec \bar{\kappa}_x})$$
                    $$Y \mapsto Y_{\bar{x}}$$
                where $Y_{\bar{x}} \cong Y \x_X \Spec \bar{\kappa}_x$; one can then take the underlying set of $Y_{\bar{x}}$ to get the following trivially left-exact functor:
                    $$F_{\bar{x}}: (\Sch_{/X})_{\fet} \to \Fin\Sets$$
                    $$Y \mapsto |Y_{\bar{x}}|$$
                We should also verify that the sets $|Y_{\bar{x}}|$ are indeed finite. To this end, let us first apply the fact that pullbacks of \'etale morphisms are \'etale to see that if $Y$ is affine over $X$ then $Y_{\bar{x}}$ will have to be the spectrum of an \'etale $\bar{\kappa}_x$-algebra; however, according to \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/00U3}{Tag 00U3}]{stacks}, this means that $Y_{\bar{x}} \cong \Spec (\bar{\kappa}_x)^{\oplus N}$ for some finite $N$. The locality of \'etale-ness and the finiteness of $Y$ as an $X$-scheme then tells us that in general, $Y_{\bar{x}}$ must be a finite disjoint union of affine schemes of the form $\Spec (\bar{\kappa}_x)^{\oplus N}$, meaning that $Y_{\bar{x}} \cong \Spec (\bar{\kappa}_x)^{\oplus N'}$ for some finite $N'$. The set $|Y_{\bar{x}}|$ is therefore always finite. One also sees that an immediate consequence of this proof is that $F_{\bar{x}}$ necessarily \textit{reflects isomorphisms} and is \textit{right-exact}. 
                
                It thus remains to show that $F_{\bar{x}}$ is \textit{pro-representable}. For this, observe first of all that as a functor on $\Sch_{/X}$ (as opposed to a functor on $(\Sch_{/X})_{\fet}$), $F_{\bar{x}}$ is naturally isomorphic to $\Sch_{/X}(\bar{x}, -)$. Then, we get the pro-representability of $F_{\bar{x}}$ from the fact that $\bar{x}$ is a pro-object of $(\Sch_{/\Spec \kappa_x})_{\fet}$.
                
                We have thus constructed a well-defined fibre functor, in the sense of definition \ref{def: galois_categories}:
                    $$F_{\bar{x}}: (\Sch_{/X})_{\fet} \to \Fin\Sets$$
                    $$Y \mapsto |Y_{\bar{x}}|$$
            \end{remark}
            \begin{remark}[Finite \'etale Galois schemes] \label{remark: galois_schemes}
                Fix a base scheme $X$, and thanks to the fact that objects of Galois categories ($(\Sch_{/X})_{\fet}$ in this instance) can be written as finite coproducts of connected objects, we can assume without loss of generality that $X$ is connected. By definition \ref{def: galois_categories}, a Galois object in $(\Sch_{/X})_{\fet}$ is a finite-\'etale $X$-scheme $Y$ such that $Y/\Aut_X(Y) \cong X$. 
            \end{remark}
            \begin{definition}[\'Etale fundamental groups] \label{def: etale_fundamental_groups}
                For any scheme $X$ with a fixed geometric point $\bar{x}$, the pair $((\Sch_{/X})_{\fet}, F_{\bar{x}})$ as in remark \ref{remark: finite_etale_schemes} defines a Galois category. Its fundamental group is commonly denoted by $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x})$ and called the \textbf{\'etale fundamental group} of $X$ based at $\bar{x}$.
            \end{definition}
            \begin{remark}[\'Etale fundamental groups as automorphism groups of universal covers] \label{remark: etale_fundamental_groups_as_automorphism_groups_of_universal_covers}
                In remark \ref{remark: finite_etale_schemes}, we have implicitly shown that the full subcategory $(\Sch_{/X})_{\fet}^{\Gal}$ is a diagram in $(\Sch_{/X})_{\fet}$ such that  
            \end{remark}
            \begin{remark}[The Geometric Galois Correspondence] \label{remark: geometric_galois_correspondence}
                Let $(X, \bar{x})$ be a pointed connected scheme. Then by proposition \ref{prop: categorical_galois_correspondence}, there is an equivalence of categories:
                    $$\{\text{Finite-index subgroups of $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x})$}\}$$
                    $$\cong$$
                    $$\{\text{Finite \'etale $X$-schemes $Y$ with base points $\bar{y}$ lying over $\bar{x}$}\}$$
                Furthermore (and also thanks to proposition \ref{prop: categorical_galois_correspondence}), this equivalence restricts down to:
                    $$\{\text{Finite-index normal subgroups of $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x})$}\}$$
                    $$\cong$$
                    $$\{\text{Finite \'etale Galois $X$-schemes $Y$ with base points $\bar{y}$ lying over $\bar{x}$}\}$$
                As a consequence, should $H$ be a finite-index normal subgroup of $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x})$ and $(X^H, \bar{x}^H)$ be the corresponding Galois $X$-scheme with a choice of base point $\bar{x}^H$ lying over $\bar{x}$, then $\pi_1(X^H_{\fet}, \bar{x}^H) \cong H$. 
            \end{remark}
            \begin{example}[The \'etale fundamental group of a field] \label{example: etale_fundamental_group_of_a_field}
                As a sanity check, note that if $K$ is a field then finite-\'etale Galois schemes over $\Spec K$ shall be of the form $\Spec L \to \Spec K$, where $L/K$ is a finite Galois extension, and as a consequence, there are there are the following equivalences of lattices, which demonstrate that remark \ref{remark: geometric_galois_correspondence} directly generalises the classical Galois Correspondence:
                    $$\{\text{Finite-index normal subgroups of $\pi_1((\Spec K)_{\fet})$}\}$$
                    $$\cong$$
                    $$\{\text{Finite \'etale Galois schemes over $\Spec K$}\}$$
                    $$\cong$$
                    $$\{\text{Finite Galois extensions of $K$}\}^{\op}$$
                    $$\cong$$
                    $$\{\text{Finite-index normal subgroups of $\Gal(\bar{K}/K)$}\}$$
            \end{example}
            \begin{example}[The \'etale fundamental group of a curve] \label{example: etale_fundamental_group_of_a_curve}
                Let $k$ be a field. If $X$ is a connected non-singular projective curve over $\Spec k$ with function field $K$, then there is a canonical equivalence $({}^{K/}\Fld^{\fin, \Gal})^{\op} \cong (\Sch_{/X})_{\fet}^{\Gal}$ between the lattice of finite Galois extensions of $K$ and Galois $X$-schemes (which are precisely dominant rational maps whose associated function field extensions are Galois). Through this, it is easy to see that:
                    $$\pi_1(X_{\fet}) \cong \Gal(\bar{K}/K)$$
                For instance, we have:
                    $$\pi_1((\P^1_k)_{\fet}) \cong \Gal(\bar{k}/k)$$
                (since the function field of $\P^1_k$ is $k(t)$), which tells us that $\P^1_k$ is simply \'etale-connected if and only if $k$ is algebraically closed (since $\Gal(\bar{k}/k)$ is \textit{a fortiori} trivial in that case). 
            \end{example}
        
        \subsubsection{Properties of \'etale fundamental groups}
            Now, let us make sure that the \'etale fundamental group $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x})$ as defined in definition \ref{def: etale_fundamental_groups} is meaningful as a formal construction. Namely, we would like to know the behaviours of $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x})$ when we change the base point and when we base-change (cf. proposition \ref{prop: etale_fundamental_groups_do_not_depend_on_base_points}), as well as whether or not \'etale fibrations induce homotopy exact sequences of fundamental groups (cf. proposition \ref{prop: etale_homotopy_exact_sequence}). 
            \begin{proposition}[\'Etale fundamental group do not depend on base points] \label{prop: etale_fundamental_groups_do_not_depend_on_base_points}
                \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BQA}{Tag 0BQA}]{stacks} Let $f: Y \to X$ be a morphism of connected qcqs\footnote{quasi-compact and quasi-separated} schemes such that the base change functor $X' \mapsto X' \x_X Y$ is an equivalence of Galois categories between $(\Sch_{/X})_{\fet}$ and $(\Sch_{/Y})_{\fet}$. Then, for any choice of geometric points $\bar{x} \in X$ and $\bar{y} \in Y$, one has the following isomorphism of \'etale fundamental groups $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x}) \cong \pi_1(Y_{\fet}, \bar{y})$.
            \end{proposition}
            \begin{corollary}[Uniqueness of \'etale fundamental groups] \label{coro: etale_fundamental_group_uniqueness}
                For any connected qcqs scheme $X$ and any pair of possibly distinct geometric points $\bar{x}, \bar{x}' \in X$, one has any isomorphism of \'etale fundamental groups $\pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x}) \cong \pi_1(X_{\fet}, \bar{x}')$, and therefore it makes sense to only speak of \textit{the} fundamental group of $X$, which we shall denote by $\pi_1(X_{\fet})$.
            \end{corollary}
            
            \begin{proposition}[The \'etale homotopy exact sequence] \label{prop: etale_homotopy_exact_sequence}
                \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C0J}{Tag 0C0J}]{stacks} Let $X$ be a connected scheme. If $f: Y \to X$ be a flat proper morphism of finite presentation whose geometric fibres $Y_{\bar{x}}$ are connected and reduced, then for any geometric point $\bar{x} \in X$, there exists a right-exact sequence of groups as follows:
                    $$\pi_1((Y_{\bar{x}})_{\fet}) \to \pi_1(Y_{\fet}) \to \pi_1(X_{\fet}) \to 1$$
            \end{proposition}
    
    \subsection{\texorpdfstring{$\ell$}{}-adic sheaves and Grothendieck's Galois Theory}
        \subsubsection{Artin-Rees categories and adic sheaves}
            \begin{definition}[Artin-Rees categories] \label{def: artin_rees_categories}
                The \textbf{Artin-Rees category} associated to an abelian category $\calA$ is the full subcategory of $\Pro(\calA)$ spanned by cofiltered diagrams $\{M_n\}_{n \in \Z}$; we denote it by $\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR})$. Of particular interest are the so-called \textbf{null systems}, which are objects $\{M_n\}_{n \in \Z} \in \calA_{\bullet}^{\AR})$ such that there exists $\nu \in \N$ so that for all $n \in \Z$ the morphism $M_n \to M_{n + \nu}$ is zero.
            \end{definition}
            
            \begin{proposition}[Artin-Rees categories are abelian] \label{prop: artin_rees_categories_are_abelian}
                For any abelian category $\calA$, the associated Artin-Rees category $\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR})$ is also abelian, with zero objects being the null systems.
            \end{proposition}
            \begin{corollary}[AR-isomorphisms] \label{coro: AR_isomorphisms}
                For any abelian category $\calA$, an isomorphism in $\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR})$ (henceforth referred to as an \textbf{AR-isomorphism}) is a morphism in $\Pro(\calA)$ whose kernel and cokernel are null.
            \end{corollary}
            \begin{proposition}[Artin-Rees categories are tensor categories] \label{prop: artin_rees_categories_are_linear}
                For all rings $\Lambda$, if a given abelian category $\calA$ is (locally finite) $\Lambda$-linear\footnote{I.e. if hom-sets of $\calA$ are (locally finite) $\Lambda$-modules.} for some commutative ring $\Lambda$ (e.g. $\calA \cong \Lambda\mod$) then the associated Artin-Rees category $\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR})$ will also be a (locally finite) $\Lambda$-linear abelian category. Furthermore, if $\calA$ is (closed) symmetric monoidal then $\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR})$ will also be (closed) symmetric monoidal (with respect to term-wise tensor products). 
            \end{proposition}
                \begin{proof}
                    The first assertion is \cite[Example 1.4.1.6]{conrad_etale_cohomology}.
                \end{proof}
            
            \begin{convention}[The setting for adic sheaves] \label{conv: l_adic_sheaves_conventions}
                For our purposes, $\calX$ shall be a scheme that is locally of finite type\footnote{Althought $\calX$ might actually be an algebraic stack of finite type over $S$; for details, see \cite{laszlo_olsson_adic_sheaves_on_artin_stacks_1} and \cite{laszlo_olsson_adic_sheaves_on_artin_stacks_2}. It should also be noted that in \cite[Subsection 1.4]{conrad_etale_cohomology}, it was only required that $\calX$ would be Noetherian, which is not sufficient for us, as $\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)$ is merely locally of finite type, and hence only locally Noetherian \textit{a priori}.} over a base scheme $S$, which we take to be is affine, regular, Noetherian\footnote{Note that this implies that $\calX$ is locally Noetherian (cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01T6}{Tag 01T6}]{stacks}).} and of dimension $\leq 1$, and of characteristic $p \geq 0$; moreoever, we would like to work under the assumption that every finite-type $S$-scheme $T$ is also of finite cohomological dimension. In addition, $\Lambda$ shall be a discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal $\m$, residue characteristic $\ell \not = p$ (e.g. $\Lambda \cong \Z_{\ell}$), and fraction field $K$.
            \end{convention}
            
            \begin{definition}[Torsion objects in tensor categories] \label{def: torsion_objects_in_tensor_categories}
                Let $A$ be a commutative ring, $I$ be an ideal of $A$, and $(\calA, \tensor, \1)$ be an $A$-linear clsoed monoidal category. Then, the subcategory of $\calA$ spanned by $I$-torsion objects is the one wherein the hom-sets are $\Hom_{\calA/I}(M, N) \cong A/I \tensor_A \Hom_\calA(M, N)$.
            \end{definition}
            \begin{definition}[Adic objects and lisse objects of Artin-Rees categories] \label{def: adic_objects_and_lisse_objects_of_artin_rees_categories}
                Consider the Artin-Rees category $\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR}$ associated to a locally finite $\Lambda$-linear closed monoidal category $(\calA, \tensor, \1)$. 
                    \begin{enumerate}
                        \item \textbf{(Adic objects):} $\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR}$ admits a full subcategory, denoted by $\calA_{\bullet}^{\ad}$, whose objects $\{M_n\}_{n \in \Z}$ are such that:
                            \begin{itemize}
                                \item $M_n \cong 0$ for all $n < 0$,
                                \item $M_n$ is $\m^{n + 1}$-torsion for all $n \geq 0$, and
                                \item the canonical maps $\Lambda/\m^{n + 2} \tensor_{\Lambda} \Hom_{\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR}}(M_{\bullet}, N_{\bullet}) \to \Hom_{\calA_{\bullet}^{\AR}}(M_{\bullet}, N_{\bullet})/\m^n$ are isomorphisms of $\Lambda/\m^{n + 1}$-modules for all $n \geq 0$.
                            \end{itemize}
                        Objects of this full subcategory are said to be \textbf{$\m$-adic}.
                        \item \textbf{(Lisse objects):} Let $\calA_{\bullet}^{\fin}$ denote the category of Artin-Rees projective systems of finite (i.e. Artinian and Noetherian) objects of $\calA$. Objects of the category $\calA_{\bullet}^{\lisse} := \calA_{\bullet}^{\ad} \cap \calA_{\bullet}^{\fin}$ are then said to be \textbf{lisse}. 
                    \end{enumerate}
            \end{definition}
            \begin{proposition}[Adic categories are tensor categories] \label{prop: adic_categories_are_tensor_categories}
                Let $\calA$ be a locally finite $\Lambda$-linear closed monoidal category. Then, we shall have a tower $\calA_{\bullet}^{\lisse} \subset \calA_{\bullet}^{\ad} \subset \calA_{\bullet}^{\AR}$ of locally finite $\Lambda$-linear closed monoidal categories, wherein the inclusions are fully faithful monoidal functors.
            \end{proposition}
            \begin{example}[Adic and lisse $\Lambda$-sheaves] \label{example: adic_sheaves}
                Recall first of all that the category of constructible \'etale sheaves of $\Lambda$-modules on a Noetherian scheme (of which $\Lambda\mod^{\cons}(\calX_{\et})$ is a special case) is a locally finite $\Lambda$-linear closed monoidal category (to see why, combine \cite[Propositions 3.20 and 3.22]{behrend_l_adic_sheaves_for_algebraic_stacks}). Then, the category of adic constructible $\m$-adic sheaves on $\calX$ (also called constructible $\Lambda$-sheaves), commonly denoted by $\Shv_{\Lambda}^{\ad}(\calX)$, is nothing but $\Lambda\mod^{\cons}(\calX_{\et})_{\bullet}^{\ad}$, and the category of lisse $\m$-adic sheaves on $\calX$, denoted by $\Shv_{\Lambda}^{\lisse}(\calX)$ is simply $\Lambda\mod^{\cons}(\calX_{\et})_{\bullet}^{\lisse}$.
            \end{example}
            
            \begin{theorem}[Galois representations are lisse $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$-sheaves] \label{theorem: galois_representations_are_lisse_sheaves}
                \cite[Theorem 1.4.5.7]{conrad_etale_cohomology} Let $\calX$ be a connected Noetherian scheme and fix a geometric point $\bar{x} \in \calX$. Then, there exists a monoidal equivalence given by $\calF \mapsto \calF_{\bar{x}}$, from the symmetric monoidal category $\Shv_{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}^{\lisse}(\calX)$ of lisse $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$-sheaves to the symmetric monoidal category $\Rep_{\bar{\Q}_{\ell}}^{\cont, \fin}(\pi_1(\calX_{\fet}))$ of finite-dimensional continuous $\bar{\Q}_{\ell}$-representations of $\pi_1(X_{\fet})$.
