\section{Introduction}
    The paper will be organised into two main sections, detailing what we shall call the \textbf{Galois Side} and the \textbf{Automorphic Side} of geometric class field theory. This introductory section will be dedicated to the outlining of our approach to these sections, as well as for laying down some conventions that we will be following until the end of the paper.

    \subsection{The Galois Side}
        Geometric class field theory is the idea that the study of function fields $K$ over $\F_q$ (i.e. finite extensions of $\F_q(t)$) can be formulated purely in terms of the machineries of algebraic geometry. More specifically, it is the idea that given Galois extensions $L/K$, one can decribe the Galois groups $\Gal(L/K)$ in purely geometric terms, via a gadget called the \textbf{\'etale fundamental group}. This, however, is only a meaningful endeavour should we know the underlying geometric space whose \'etale fundamental group would end up being the Galois groups that we are interested in.
        
        Our starting point is the following result, which explains why one might even suspect any sort of involvement of algebraic geometry in the first place:
        \begin{lemma}[Varieties and field extensions] \label{lemma: varieties_and_field_extensions}
            \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BXN}{Tag 0BXN}]{stacks} Let $k$ be a field. Then, $\trdeg K_X = \dim X$ for all varieties $X/k$, and there exists a canonical equivalence of categories as follows:
                $$\{\text{Finite-type field extensions $K/k$ and $k$-algebra homomorphisms}\}^{\op}$$
                $$\cong$$
                $$\{\text{Varieties $X/k$ and \href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01RI}{\underline{dominant}} \href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01RR}{\underline{rational}} maps}\}$$
        \end{lemma}
            \begin{proof}
                If $f: X \to Y$ is a dominant map of varieties and if $\eta_X$ and $\eta_Y$ are the unique generic points of $X$ and $Y$ (unique because varieties are integral by definition, and every integral scheme \textit{a priori} has a unique generic point), then $f(\eta_X) = \eta_Y$ per the definition of dominant morphisms. The residue field at generic points are precisely the function fields (consider the stalk of the structure sheaves at the generic points to see why this is the case), so we have obtained a map of function fields $K_Y \to K_X$. We leave the proof of finiteness up to the reader.
            \end{proof}
        Through lemma \ref{lemma: varieties_and_field_extensions}, one obtains the following regarding the relationship between curves (i.e. algebraic varieties of dimension $1$) and their function fields (which \textit{a priori} are of transcedence degree $1$ over the ground field) with little difficulty:
        \begin{proposition}[Curves and function fields] \label{prop: curves_and_function_fields}
            \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BY1}{Tag 0BY1}]{stacks} For any field $k$, one has the following canonical equivalences of categories:
                $$\{\text{Field extensions $K/k$ of transcendence degree $1$ and $k$-algebra homomorphisms}\}^{\op}$$
                $$\cong$$
                $$\{\text{Curves $X/k$ and dominant rational maps}\}$$
                $$\cong$$
                $$\{\text{Non-singular projective curves $X/k$ and dominant rational maps}\}$$
        \end{proposition}
            \begin{proof}
                The first equivalence is an obvious consequence of lemma \ref{lemma: varieties_and_field_extensions}. To show that the second equivalence holds, note firstly that there is an evident fully faithful functor from the third category to the second; we shall need to show that this functor is also essentially surjective. For this, simply recall that for each curve $X/k$, there exists a non-singular projective curve $\tilde{X}/k$ that is birational to $X/k$, namely $X^{\nu} \cup \{\infty_1, ..., \infty_n\}$, the normalisation $X^{\nu}/k$ of $X/k$ with finitely many extra points (recall also that any normal Noetherian scheme of dimension $\leq 1$ is \textit{a priori} non-singular; cf. \cite[\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0BX2}{Tag 0BX2}]{stacks}).
            \end{proof}
            
        Through proposition \ref{prop: curves_and_function_fields}, we obtain the first crucial tool for the geometrisation of class field theory.
        \begin{corollary}[Galois covers of curves and Galois extensions] \label{coro: galois_covers_of_curves_and_galois_extensions}
            Let $k$ be a field. If $X$ is a connected non-singular projective curve over $\Spec k$ with function field $K$, then there is a canonical equivalence:
                $$({}^{K/}\Fld^{\fin, \Gal})^{\op} \cong \Sch_{/X}^{\fet, \Gal}$$
            between the category of finite Galois extensions of $K$ and finite \'etale-Galois covers of $X$ (i.e. finite \'etale covers generated by Galois morphisms, which are necessarily dominant rational maps such that the associated function field extensions are Galois). 
        \end{corollary}
        The importance of corollary \ref{coro: galois_covers_of_curves_and_galois_extensions} can not be understated: what it tells us is essentially that the Galois group $\Gal(K^{\ab}/K)$ is nothing but the \'etale fundamental group of $\Sch_{/X}^{\fet, \Gal}$ (more on this later, after we have introduced the \'etale fundamental group; cf. definition \ref{def: etale_fundamental_groups}). This, already, is one side of the Artin's Reciprocity Law, which we shall refer to as \say{\textbf{The Galois Side}} per popular conventions. Actually, this is a bit of a lie: instead of formulating geometric class field theory directly in terms of the \'etale fundamental group $\pi_1^{\ab}(X_{\fet})$ (or rather, its continuous $\ell$-adic characters), we will be phrasing things in terms of $\ell$-adic local systems of rank $1$ on $X$; the main result on the Galois Side shall be theorem \ref{theorem: unramified_representations_are_sheaves_on_X}, which rigorously and precisely establishes the categorification of continuous representations of $\pi_1^{\ab}(X_{\fet})$ to $\ell$-adic local systems on $X$ via a canonical equivalence of categories:
            $$\Rep^1_{\overline{\Q_{\ell}}}(\pi_1^{\ab}(X_{\fet}))^{\cont} \cong \LocSys^1_{\overline{\Q_{\ell}}}(X)$$
        
        One last remark pertaining to the Galois Side is that because we are working in the \'etale topology, everything is necessarily unramified, since \'etale morphisms are unramified smooth morphisms by definition.
    
    \subsection{The Automorphic Side}
        Let us now move on to what is known as the \say{\textbf{Automorphic Side}}, and we shall begin with the notion of \textbf{Hecke eigensheaves}. To introduce these gadgets, however, we will first need to discuss the \textbf{Hecke correspondence}, the categorification of the action of the Hecke algebra on the space of functions satisfying certain smoothness and growth conditions on the double ad\`elic quotient $\GL_1(K) \backslash \GL_1(\A_K) / \GL_1(\scrO_K)$ (i.e. automorphic forms). The details will be spelled out in definition \ref{def: hecke_correspondence}, but for now, let us think of the Hecke correspondence as a span, i.e. a diagram of the form:
            $$
                \begin{tikzcd}
                	& {\Hecke_{\GL_1}(X)} \\
                	{\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)} && {X \x \Bun_{\GL_1}(X)}
                	\arrow["{\cev{h}}"', from=1-2, to=2-1]
                	\arrow["{\supp_X \x \vec{h}}", from=1-2, to=2-3]
                \end{tikzcd}
            $$
        If we were to generically denote a given category of \say{good sheaf theory} by $\Shv(-)$\footnote{Eventually, we will be interested particularly in $\ell$-adic sheaves of rank $1$, which shall be denoted by $\Shv_{\overline{\Q_{\ell}}}^1(-)$, but more on this later. In the wider context of the Geometric Langlands Programme, $\Shv(-)$ might mean perverse sheaves, or when we are working over $\bbC$, D-modules; we shall not touch on these sheaf theories.}, then the Hecke correspondence induces the following sheaf pull-push diagram:
            $$
                \begin{tikzcd}
                	& {\Shv(\Hecke_{\GL_1}(X))} \\
                	{\Shv(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X))} && {\Shv(X \x \Bun_{\GL_1}(X))}
                	\arrow["{\cev{h}^*}", from=2-1, to=1-2]
                	\arrow["{(\supp_X \x \vec{h})_*}", from=1-2, to=2-3]
                \end{tikzcd}
            $$
        and by composing the two functors in the obvious manner, one gets a new functor:
            $$\scrH_X: \Shv(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)) \to \Shv(X \x \Bun_{\GL_1}(X))$$
        This is commonly known as the \textbf{Hecke functor} or the \textbf{Hecke operator} (should we want to put emphasis on the spectral nature of $\scrH_X$), and it is of central importance to us. However, before we can explain why this is the case, observe that the Hecke operator $\scrH_X$ is actually \say{global} in a sense: the fibre of $\supp_X \x \vec{h}$ over any given point $x \in X$ is the \say{local} Hecke correspondence:
            $$
                \begin{tikzcd}
                	& {\Hecke_{\GL_1}(x)} \\
                	{\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)} && {\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)}
                	\arrow["{\cev{h}}"', from=1-2, to=2-1]
                	\arrow["{\vec{h}}", from=1-2, to=2-3]
                \end{tikzcd}
            $$
        and one can thus define the local Hecke operator at $x \in X$ as:
            $$\scrH_x := \vec{h}_* \cev{h}^*$$
        Arguably, this is more akin to the classical Hecke operator, as it is an endofunctor on $\Shv(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X))$ as opposed to a functor $\scrH_X: \Shv(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X)) \to \Shv(X \x \Bun_{\GL_1}(X))$; henceforth, we will be thinking of the global Hecke operator $\scrH_X$ as a family $\{\scrH_x\}_{x \in X}$ of local Hecke operators parametrised by points $x \in X$. 
        
        Now, via the local Hecke operators, one can define the Hecke eigensheaves that we eluded to earlier: as the name suggests, these are nothing but sheaves $\E \in \Shv(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X))$ that are \say{\textbf{eigenvectors}} of the local Hecke operators $\scrH_x$, i.e. for each such $\E$, there exists an \say{\textbf{eigenvalue}} $L \in \Vect(\overline{\Q_{\ell}})$ such that:
            $$\scrH_x(\E) \cong L_x \boxtimes \E$$
        (where $L_x \in \Shv(X)$ denotes the skyscraper sheaf with value $L$ and supported at $x \in X$). It is easy to see that Hecke eigensheaves form a full symmetric monoidal subcategory of $\Shv_{\overline{\Q_{\ell}}}^n(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X))$, which we shall denote by $\Eig^1_{\overline{\Q_{\ell}}}(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X))$. At this point, we will be able to state and prove the main theorem of this section, which establishes a canonical equivalence between the category of rank-$1$ $\ell$-adic local systems on $X$ and the category of ($\ell$-adic) Hecke eigensheaves of rank $1$ on $\Bun_{\GL_1(X)}$:
            $$\LocSys_{\overline{\Q_{\ell}}}^1(X) \cong \Eig^1_{\overline{\Q_{\ell}}}(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X))$$
        which maps each local system $\calL \in \LocSys_{\overline{\Q_{\ell}}}^1(X)$ to a Hecke eigensheaf $\Aut_{\calL} \in \Eig^1_{\overline{\Q_{\ell}}}(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X))$ with eigenvalue $\calL$.
        
        By putting theorem \ref{theorem: unramified_representations_are_sheaves_on_X} and theorem \ref{theorem: unramified_abelian_geometric_class_field_theory} together, one gets a canonical equivalence of categories:
            $$\Rep_{\overline{\Q_{\ell}}}^1(\pi_1^{\ab}(X_{\fet}))^{\cont} \cong \Eig^1_{\overline{\Q_{\ell}}}(\Bun_{\GL_1}(X))$$
        This is the version of global class field theory that we seek, and it tells us that $1$-dimensional continuous $\ell$-adic Galois representations are the same as automorphic forms associated to $\GL_1$.
